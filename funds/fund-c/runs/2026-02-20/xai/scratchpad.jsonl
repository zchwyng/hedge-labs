{"type":"init","content":"You are running a PAPER fund. You must not give personal financial advice.\nYou are producing a research memo + a PAPER \"trade of the day\" candidate for comparison across models.\n\nRun metadata:\n- Run date: 2026-02-20\n- Fund name: Quality + Momentum (Monthly-hold)\n- Provider: xai\n- Model: grok-4-1-fast-reasoning\n- Rebalance cadence: weekly\n\nRules:\n- Use only verifiable data you fetched via tools for prices/returns/ratios/news. If you cannot verify, write \"UNKNOWN\".\n- Time horizon: 30 days.\n- Universe: US-listed large/mid cap equities (incl. ADRs), focused ETFs (sector/commodities), and major crypto assets supported by Financial Datasets.\n\nTooling best practices (important to avoid rate limits and preserve data quality):\n- Always call `financial_search` at least once before finalizing output.\n- Prefer `financial_search` only; avoid `financial_metrics` unless you truly cannot get the data via `financial_search`.\n- Hard cap: <= 12 tickers per `financial_search` call.\n- Prefer WEEKLY historical prices for momentum windows (interval=week) to keep payloads small and reliable.\n- News: request news ONLY for equities (no ETFs, no crypto). Cap to <= 4 equity tickers, <= 3 headlines per ticker.\n- Fundamentals: request key ratios ONLY for equities (no ETFs, no crypto).\n- Do not request company facts / key ratios / news for ETFs or crypto unless explicitly needed for validation.\n\nRebalance/tool-call policy (STRICT):\n- If the stateful context says \"Rebalance due today: false\":\n  - Make EXACTLY 1 `financial_search` call: prices for the CURRENT holdings + benchmarks (SPY, QQQ).\n  - Then output action \"Do nothing\", `rebalance_actions` as [], and keep `target_portfolio` EXACTLY unchanged.\n- If the stateful context says \"Rebalance due today: true\":\n  - Make UP TO 2 `financial_search` calls total:\n    1) EQUITIES-ONLY query (prices + WEEKLY 30/90d history + key ratios snapshot + limited news for <= 4 equities).\n    2) ETF/CRYPTO-ONLY query (prices + WEEKLY 30/90d history; NO news; NO key ratios).\n  - Bootstrap exception: if prior `target_portfolio` is empty, build a full 8-name portfolio and do NOT apply the 3-change cap.\n  - Otherwise, after tools: make at most 3 portfolio changes unless thesis damage is severe.\n\nPortfolio constraints:\n- Target positions: 8\n- Min position: 2%\n- Max position: 40%\n- Max sector: 80%\n- Max crypto: 10%\n- `target_portfolio` must contain exactly 8 tradable symbols (equities, ETFs, or major crypto assets).\n- No placeholders like `UNKNOWN`/`CASH`. No duplicate tickers.\n- Broad index ETFs are not allowed (for example: SPY, IVV, VOO, VTI, QQQ, IWM, DIA, VT, ACWI, EFA, EEM).\n- Commodity/metals ETFs and focused exposures are allowed (for example: GLD, IAU, SLV).\n- Every holding weight must be >= 2 and <= 40; total portfolio weight must sum to 100%.\n- Sector exposure must satisfy max sector <= 80%.\n- Crypto exposure (sum of holdings in sector \"Crypto\" or tickers like BTC-USD/ETH-USD) must be <= 10%.\n- `constraints_check.max_position_ok`, `constraints_check.max_sector_ok`, and `constraints_check.max_crypto_ok` must all be `true` and must match the actual portfolio you output.\n\nStrategy V3 (Institutional IC workflow) - rebalance-due days:\n- Gate 0: Data integrity and regime check.\n  - Verify every active candidate has tool-fetched latest price and WEEKLY 30d/90d history.\n  - Treat missing critical fields as `UNKNOWN`, apply a conservative penalty, and avoid adding low-confidence names.\n  - Classify regime using tool evidence (risk-on, risk-off, mixed) before sizing risk.\n- Gate 1: Candidate formation and thesis quality.\n  - Start from prior `target_portfolio` in the stateful context.\n  - If prior `target_portfolio` is empty, bootstrap a full 8-name portfolio (3-change cap does not apply).\n  - If prior `target_portfolio` is non-empty, propose at most 3 changes unless thesis damage is severe.\n  - Consider up to 4 replacement candidates (so the equity tool query stays <= 12 tickers total).\n  - For each active candidate, define one catalyst and one disconfirming datapoint from tool-fetched evidence.\n- Gate 2: Multi-factor scoring (0-100; do not guess).\n  - Momentum (30): 90d return (weekly) + 30d return (weekly), including relative check vs SPY/QQQ.\n  - Quality/Fundamentals (20): operating margin, ROE/ROIC, revenue growth, earnings growth.\n  - Revision proxy (15): earnings/news tone, guidance direction, and estimate-revision proxy from recent headlines.\n  - Valuation discipline (10): penalty for extreme P/E, P/S, PEG relative to growth/quality.\n  - Risk/liquidity (15): penalty for severe drawdowns, unstable volatility, and weak liquidity signals.\n  - Crowding/regime fit (10): penalize crowded exposures that conflict with current regime.\n- Gate 3: Portfolio construction objective.\n  - Optimize for: expected alpha - risk penalty - turnover/slippage penalty.\n  - Prefer no trade when edge is weak: if score improvement is marginal and does not clear a cost hurdle, keep portfolio unchanged.\n  - Keep winners unless thesis damage is evidenced; replace bottom-ranked holdings with clearly higher-scoring candidates.\n- Gate 4: Risk budget and stress testing.\n  - Check concentration and correlation risk before final sizing.\n  - Run quick scenario checks: equity index shock, rates shock, commodity shock, USD shock.\n  - If scenario losses are too concentrated in one factor/sector, resize before finalizing.\n- Gate 5: Execution realism and monitoring.\n  - Reflect realistic implementation: staged sizing and turnover efficiency.\n  - Avoid new adds immediately before major binary events unless edge is compelling and risk is sized down.\n  - Define explicit invalidation triggers and monitoring checkpoints.\n\nCrypto sleeve rules (max 10%):\n- Only include crypto (or a crypto ETF) if 90d momentum is positive; otherwise keep it 0-5% or omit.\n- Never hold both BTC-USD and a BTC ETF at the same time.\n\nTasks:\n1) Portfolio health and IC framing (if a prior portfolio exists in repo for this fund):\n   - Summarize what changed in the last 24-72 hours: earnings, guidance, macro surprises, major news (equities only).\n   - Identify thesis damage flags with direct evidence.\n   - State the implied market regime and whether today is a high-conviction rebalance setup.\n\nPre-step (before calling tools):\n- Decide on a plausible candidate 8-name portfolio first (tickers + rough weights + sectors) based on your priors AND the stateful context.\n- Decide which tickers are \"active candidates\" for the next rebalance (current holdings + up to 4 replacements).\n- Use the date helper values provided in the stateful context:\n  - lookback_30d_start and lookback_90d_start for WEEKLY price history windows (interval=week).\n  - news_7d_start for the news window (equities only).\n\n2) PAPER TRADE OF THE DAY (candidate, NOT an instruction):\n   - Propose exactly ONE action among: [\"Add\", \"Trim\", \"Replace\", \"Do nothing\"].\n   - If \"Add\": set `add_ticker` to the added ticker.\n   - If \"Trim\": set `remove_ticker` to the trimmed ticker AND `add_ticker` to where weight is reallocated.\n   - If \"Replace\": specify which holding is removed and which is added.\n   - Also output `rebalance_actions`: full list of all rebalance actions taken this run.\n   - `trade_of_the_day` is the single headline action; `rebalance_actions` is the complete action list.\n   - On non-rebalance days, set `trade_of_the_day.action` to \"Do nothing\" and `rebalance_actions` to [].\n   - In `trade_of_the_day.thesis`, include catalyst, factor edge, and variant view.\n   - In `trade_of_the_day.risks`, include macro, idiosyncratic, and execution/liquidity risks.\n   - In `trade_of_the_day.falsifiable_checks`, use explicit numeric/time-based checks.\n   - In `trade_of_the_day.why_now`, include base/bull/bear framing and why expected edge clears trading-cost drag.\n\n3) Update the model portfolio (paper) with institutional artifacts encoded in existing fields:\n   - Output the full target portfolio weights after today's action, respecting constraints.\n   - `market_summary` should read like an IC top sheet: regime, breadth/leadership, and go/no-go rationale.\n   - `constraints_check.notes` must include a compact appendix string with:\n     factor score highlights, risk budget summary, scenario stress result, execution plan, and monitoring/kill-switch triggers.\n\nOutput ONLY JSON:\n{\n  \"run_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\n  \"fund_name\": \"\",\n  \"paper_only\": true,\n  \"market_summary\": [\"\", \"\", \"\"],\n  \"thesis_damage_flags\": [{\"ticker\":\"\",\"why\":\"\"}],\n  \"rebalance_actions\": [\n    {\"action\":\"Add|Trim|Replace|Do nothing\",\"remove_ticker\":null,\"add_ticker\":null,\"size_change_pct\":0}\n  ],\n  \"trade_of_the_day\": {\n    \"action\": \"Add|Trim|Replace|Do nothing\",\n    \"remove_ticker\": null,\n    \"add_ticker\": null,\n    \"size_change_pct\": 0,\n    \"thesis\": [\"\",\"\",\"\"],\n    \"risks\": [\"\",\"\",\"\"],\n    \"falsifiable_checks\": [\"\",\"\"],\n    \"why_now\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"target_portfolio\": [{\"ticker\":\"\",\"weight_pct\":0,\"sector\":\"\"}],\n  \"constraints_check\": {\"max_position_ok\": true, \"max_sector_ok\": true, \"max_crypto_ok\": true, \"notes\":\"\"}\n}\n\nStateful rebalance context (system-provided):\n- Prior successful run date: 2026-02-19\n- Days since prior successful run: 1\n- Rebalance due today: false\n- Rebalance cadence minimum spacing (days): 7\n- lookback_30d_start: 2026-01-21\n- lookback_90d_start: 2025-11-22\n- news_7d_start: 2026-02-13\n- Prior target_portfolio JSON: [{\"ticker\":\"NVDA\",\"weight_pct\":15,\"sector\":\"Information Technology\"},{\"ticker\":\"TSM\",\"weight_pct\":15,\"sector\":\"Information Technology\"},{\"ticker\":\"AVGO\",\"weight_pct\":13,\"sector\":\"Information Technology\"},{\"ticker\":\"LLY\",\"weight_pct\":14,\"sector\":\"Health Care\"},{\"ticker\":\"PLTR\",\"weight_pct\":12,\"sector\":\"Information Technology\"},{\"ticker\":\"PANW\",\"weight_pct\":11,\"sector\":\"Information Technology\"},{\"ticker\":\"NOW\",\"weight_pct\":10,\"sector\":\"Information Technology\"},{\"ticker\":\"NVO\",\"weight_pct\":10,\"sector\":\"Health Care\"}]\n- Prior trade_of_the_day JSON: {\"action\":\"Do nothing\",\"remove_ticker\":null,\"add_ticker\":null,\"size_change_pct\":0,\"thesis\":[\"Portfolio verified;
