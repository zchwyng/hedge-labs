      "Systematic weekly hold discipline enforced: Day 10 following February 12 full portfolio rebalance, rebalance cadence requires 7-day minimum spacing with next opportunity opening February 26",
      "Portfolio construction validated by Friday performance: Gold hedge delivering exceptional +1.97% gain to $468.62 (+10.2% cumulative) offsetting energy sector pressure (XOM -2.22% to $147.28, CVX -0.45% to $183.93), quality financials resilient (JPM +0.71% to $310.79), semiconductors rebounding (KLAC +1.78% to $1496), industrials steady (XLI +0.50% to $177.23)",

    "why_now": "Day 10 of systematic weekly hold period with next rebalance opportunity February 26. Friday session validated portfolio construction: risk-on rotation (SPY +0.72%, QQQ +0.89%) accompanied by continued gold strength (+1.97% to $468.62, +10.2% cumulative) demonstrating defensive hedge working as designed. Energy pressure (XOM -2.22%, CVX -0.45%) represents normal sector rotation without thesis damage. Quality names resilient (JPM +0.71%, KLAC +1.78%, XLI +0.50%) with semiconductors recovering. All falsifiable thresholds maintained with healthy cushions. Process discipline requires 7-day minimum spacing to avoid reactive management and transaction cost drag during normal volatility. Premature action would sacrifice systematic edge for tactical timing risk."
