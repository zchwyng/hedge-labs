      "Energy sector synchronous weakness: XOM -1.64% and CVX -1.72% declining in tandem suggests sector-wide pressure rather than idiosyncratic rotation, 27% concentration vulnerable if oil prices deteriorate before rebalance window",
      "Tech rotation ambiguity: AVGO recovering +1.11% while QQQ -0.18% suggests stock-specific strength vs sector pressure, but 20% combined tech allocation (AVGO/KLAC) requires monitoring if broader sector weakness persists"

      "If AVGO closes below $305 before February 19 rebalance window, emergency position review warranted despite systematic hold discipline (currently $332.54, +$27.54 cushion)",
      "If GLD falls below $440 before tomorrow's rebalance or declines >5% from current $448.20 level, reassess 18% safe-haven allocation and consider tactical profit-taking to lock +3.1% cumulative gains"

    "why_now": "Day 6 of 7-day systematic hold period following February 12 full portfolio rebalance. Tuesday intraday pricing (01:00 UTC) shows normal volatility: gold hedge experiencing largest decline -3.12% since rally began but $448.20 price remains $8.20 above $440 tactical watchpoint and still delivering +3.1% cumulative portfolio protection from 18% weight, energy giving back gains (XOM $146.19 -1.64%, CVX $180.55 -1.72%) in sector-wide profit-taking but no breakdown signals, quality compounders stable (LLY $1036.05 -0.19%, JPM $307.13 +1.51%), AVGO $332.54 recovering prior weakness and remaining $27 above $305 emergency trigger. No holdings breaching falsifiable invalidation thresholds. Premature action would sacrifice transaction cost efficiency and process discipline for reactive position management during normal intraday volatility. Optimal trade path remains systematic rebalance tomorrow February 19 with full 90-day/30-day weekly momentum rescoring, quality/fundamentals refresh, and earnings/news catalyst review across expanded candidate universe. Portfolio delivering as constructed: defensive gold providing hedge despite profit-taking, energy consolidating leadership, quality growth stable, financials showing relative strength."

Tomorrow February 19 rebalance will reassess: (1) gold hedge sizing after profit-taking, (2) energy sector allocation given synchronous weakness, (3) tech rotation dynamics with AVGO recovery vs QQQ underperformance, (4) full momentum/quality rescoring across 8 current holdings + 4 replacement candidates. No emergency action warranted today—all falsifiable checks remain satisfied."
