      "Systematic hold discipline enforced: Day 5 of 7-day minimum hold period, rebalance window opens February 19 (in 2 days) with full weekly momentum/quality rescoring across expanded candidate universe",
      "Portfolio construction delivering intended outcomes: Gold hedge exceptional (+0.63% Monday, +8.6% cumulative from $426.24 entry), energy sector stable with intraday rotation (XOM -1.39%, CVX +0.66%), quality positions showing resilience (JPM +1.35%, LLY flat)",

    "risks": [
      "AVGO weakness accumulating: -1.42% Monday decline extends 5-day underperformance, now down ~4-5% from recent highs; 10% position size contains portfolio impact but warrants close monitoring into February 19 rebalance",
      "Gold profit-taking risk near-term: +0.63% Monday advance extends GLD to $462.62, representing +8.6% gain in 5 days; parabolic trajectory may trigger retracement despite structural safe-haven demand",
      "Energy sector intraday divergence: XOM -1.39% vs CVX +0.66% Monday suggests potential leadership rotation within 27% energy allocation; consolidation phase expected after strong February performance"

    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If AVGO declines >7% from $325.17 level or breaks below $302 before February 19 rebalance window, emergency position review warranted despite systematic hold discipline",

    ],
    "why_now": "Day 5 of 7-day systematic hold period following February 12 full portfolio rebalance. Monday price action confirms portfolio construction working as designed: gold allocation delivering exceptional hedge performance (+0.63% intraday, +8.6% cumulative, contributing ~155bps to portfolio return from 18% weight), energy sector consolidating leadership (27% allocation showing healthy intraday rotation XOM/CVX), quality compounders demonstrating resilience (JPM +1.35% financial strength, LLY stable). Single-name AVGO weakness (-1.42% Monday, -4-5% from recent highs) represents normal position-level volatility within 10% allocation, not systematic thesis breakdown requiring immediate action. Premature rebalance would sacrifice transaction cost efficiency for reactive position management. Next rebalance window (February 19, in 2 days) allows full weekly momentum/quality rescoring with complete 90-day/30-day lookback data. Portfolio remains optimally positioned: energy sector leadership through 1H26 earnings cycle, defensive gold for macro volatility (18% weight justified by current outperformance), quality growth in healthcare/financials, selective technology via semiconductor capital equipment (KLAC +0.90% Monday strength) and AI infrastructure (AVGO sized for cycle volatility). Current 5-day performance validates systematic discipline over discretionary intervention. February 19 rebalance is optimal action path."
