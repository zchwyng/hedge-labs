    "risks": [
      "Gold profit-taking underway: GLD -2.2% pullback from $462.62 Friday peak to $452.53 Monday pre-market represents natural consolidation after parabolic surge, but further retracement toward $440 level would justify tactical sizing review at February 19 rebalance",
      "AVGO cumulative decline approaching watchlist threshold: $322.15 Monday price represents ~4% decline from recent highs, nearing but not breaching <$305 emergency review trigger defined in prior falsifiable checks",
      "Pre-market volume concentration in CVX (5.5K) vs XOM (228) suggesting intra-energy rotation risk: 27% sector allocation may require rebalancing between XOM/CVX positions if divergence persists through February 19 window"
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If AVGO closes below $305 before February 19 rebalance window, emergency position review warranted despite systematic hold discipline (currently $322.15, -$17 cushion)",
      "If GLD falls below $440 intraweek or declines >5% from Monday $452.53 level, reassess 18% safe-haven allocation and consider tactical profit-taking to lock +5.6% cumulative gains"
    ],
    "why_now": "Day 5 of 7-day systematic hold period following February 12 full portfolio rebalance. Monday pre-market pricing (09:01 UTC) shows normal consolidation: gold hedge -2.2% from Friday's $462.62 parabolic peak but still delivering +5.6% cumulative portfolio protection from 18% weight, energy stable (XOM $149.59, CVX $182.60 flat), quality compounders unchanged (LLY $1044.42, JPM $302.48), AVGO $322.15 weakness contained within 10% allocation. No holdings breaching falsifiable invalidation thresholds (AVGO >$17 above $305 emergency trigger, GLD >$12 above $440 retracement watchpoint). Premature action would sacrifice transaction cost efficiency and process discipline for reactive position management. Optimal trade path remains systematic rebalance on February 19-20 (in 2-3 days) with full 90-day/30-day weekly momentum rescoring, quality/fundamentals refresh, and earnings/news catalyst review across expanded candidate universe. Portfolio delivering as constructed: defensive gold offsetting equity volatility, energy consolidating sector leadership, quality growth providing stability. Weekend consolidation validates patience over action."

Systematic hold day 5/7: no rebalance actions taken, portfolio unchanged from February 12 construction. Monday pre-market (09:01 UTC) verification: all 8 holdings priced, benchmarks flat (SPY $680.32, QQQ $598.62). Gold hedge consolidating -2.2% from Friday peak but +5.6% cumulative, AVGO -0.93% contained within 10% weight, energy/quality stable. Risk budget: 27% energy concentration acceptable given sector leadership, 18% gold justified by hedge performance, 20% technology split across KLAC/AVGO diversifies AI infrastructure exposure. Scenario stress: portfolio resilient to equity shock (gold +18% offset), rates shock (energy +27% inflation hedge), commodity shock (energy direct exposure). Execution: no trades today, next rebalance February 19-20 with weekly momentum/quality rescoring. Monitoring: AVGO <$305 emergency trigger ($322.15 current, -$17 cushion), GLD <$440 profit-take review ($452.53 current, -$12.53 cushion)."
