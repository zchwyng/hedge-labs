      "Data integrity constraints prevent position-level assessment: All ticker price snapshots returned 404 errors, making valuation and momentum rescoring impossible for February 17 session",

      "If data availability is restored before February 19 rebalance window and any single position shows >8% adverse move from February 16 levels, emergency review warranted despite hold discipline",

    "why_now": "Day 5 of 7-day minimum hold period following February 12 full portfolio rebalance. Complete data availability failure (all price snapshots returned 404 errors) prevents position-level assessment but does not override systematic rebalance discipline. Prior seven-day context shows portfolio delivering as designed through February 16: gold providing exceptional hedge performance (+7.9% cumulative through Friday), energy consolidating sector leadership (27% allocation stable), quality compounders resilient (LLY/JPM), technology showing normal single-name volatility (AVGO weakness contained within 10% position size). Without current pricing data, premature action based on stale information would sacrifice process discipline and transaction cost efficiency. Systematic hold period through February 18 remains optimal path, with full rebalance assessment scheduled for February 19-20 window pending data restoration. Portfolio remains allocated to 6-18 month structural themes validated by last available evidence: energy sector leadership, defensive gold allocation, quality growth compounders, selective technology exposure. Next rebalance window (in 2-3 days) allows proper momentum/quality rescoring with complete data integrity across expanded candidate universe."
