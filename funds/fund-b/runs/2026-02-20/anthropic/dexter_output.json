Thursday session showing defensive rotation: SPY -0.26%, QQQ -0.48% with tech-led weakness, but portfolio positioned correctly with energy stability (XOM +0.31% to $150.97, CVX +0.49% to $184.78), gold hedge functioning (+0.28% to $459.56 while market declines), industrials outperforming (XLI +0.74% to $176.34), quality names resilient (LLY +0.34%, JPM -0.17%). KLAC showing sector pressure at -0.70% to $1469.90 but no thesis damage. All falsifiable thresholds maintained with healthy cushions. Rebalance cadence enforces minimum 7-day spacing; next rebalance window opens February 26. Premature action would sacrifice process discipline and transaction cost efficiency for reactive management during normal portfolio drawdown. Portfolio delivering defensive characteristics as constructed."
