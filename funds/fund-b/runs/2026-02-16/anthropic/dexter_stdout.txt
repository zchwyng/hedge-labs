    "why_now": "Day 4 of 7-day minimum hold period following February 12 full portfolio rebalance. Weekend price action confirms portfolio construction delivering as designed: gold providing exceptional hedge performance (+7.9% in 4 days, delivering ~142bps portfolio contribution from 18% weight), energy consolidating recent sector leadership (27% allocation range-bound), quality compounders showing resilience (LLY +0.31% Friday, JPM stable +0.04%). Single-name AVGO weakness (-1.81% Friday) represents normal position-level volatility within 10% allocation, not systematic thesis breakdown. Premature rebalance action would sacrifice transaction cost efficiency and systematic process discipline for reactive position management. Next rebalance window (February 19-20, in 3-4 days) allows full weekly momentum/quality rescoring with complete 90-day/30-day lookback data across expanded candidate universe. Portfolio remains optimally positioned for 6-18 month structural themes: energy sector leadership continuation through 1H26 earnings cycle, defensive gold allocation for macro volatility hedging (18% weight justified by current performance), quality growth compounders in healthcare/financials providing stability, selective technology exposure through semiconductor capital equipment cycle (KLAC) and AI infrastructure buildout (AVGO). Current 4-day performance (+gold hedge working, energy stable, quality resilient) validates patience over action. Systematic rebalance discipline on February 19-20 is the optimal trade path."
