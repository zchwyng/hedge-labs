    "SPY down -1.65% to 680.48, QQQ down -2.14% to 599.68 on Feb 12 - sharp tech selloff with high volume (98M SPY, 72M QQQ)",
    "Mag 7 tech showing material weakness: AAPL -5.24%, NVDA -3.17%, META -3.24%, TSLA -3.57%. News flags memory chip shortage concerns and AI capex skepticism",
    "Energy outperforming: XOM up 26.7% YTD to $150.44, CVX up 17.2% YTD to $182.66, COP up 13.8% YTD. Strong momentum in oil majors on supply discipline"

      "Q3 FY26 revenue $57.0B (+22% QoQ) with gross margin 73.4% and operating margin 63.2% - exceptional profitability with $31.9B net income",
      "Sequential revenue growth accelerating (Q1: $44B, Q2: $47B, Q3: $57B) driven by data center AI demand. Earnings momentum intact despite recent selloff",
      "Current pullback (-3.17% today) creates entry point in dominant AI infrastructure play. Stock trading at $186.91 vs recent highs near $200"

    "risks": [
      "Memory chip shortage concerns flagged in news (Feb 12 Benzinga) could constrain GPU production and delay customer shipments",
      "Elevated valuation at 25x forward earnings despite growth - vulnerable to macro risk-off rotation out of high-multiple tech",
      "Competitive threats from AMD, custom AI chips (Google TPU, Amazon Trainium) and China DeepSeek models showing cost-efficient AI alternatives"

    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "Q4 FY26 earnings (late Jan 2026): Revenue must exceed $60B with gross margins above 72% to confirm demand trajectory",
      "Stock price below $170 or sequential revenue decline would invalidate growth thesis and trigger exit"
    ],
    "why_now": "NVDA offers asymmetric risk/reward after today's selloff: dominant AI infrastructure position with 63% operating margins trading at recent support levels. Sequential revenue growth accelerating ($44B→$47B→$57B) validates enterprise AI adoption despite macro volatility. News-driven weakness (memory shortage fears, AI capex skepticism) creates tactical entry in best-in-class quality compounder with 30-day mean reversion catalyst as Q4 earnings approach and memory concerns prove transitory."
