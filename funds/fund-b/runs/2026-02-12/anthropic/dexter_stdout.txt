    "Tech sector under pressure: Mag 7 down 2-5% on Feb 12 with $500B wiped out. NVDA -3.2%, AAPL -4.9%, META -3.0% as memory shortage concerns emerge per Cisco margins.",
    "Crypto volatility: BTC dropped from $79K to $62K low on Feb 5, now at $65K (-17% from recent highs). ETH down from $2.5K to $1.8K low, currently $1.9K.",

      "ticker": "AAPL",

      "Quality acceleration: 73% gross margin, 41% operating margin, 22% YoY revenue growth with $5.6B net income Q3. ROE expansion with 6.2x EPS growth trajectory.",
      "Defensive rotation catalyst: Healthcare outperforming tech selloff (+1.3% vs -3.2% NVDA today). GLP-1 franchise (Mounjaro/Zepbound) driving structural demand with $17.6B Q3 revenue.",

    "risks": [
      "High valuation: 39x P/E, 30x P/B requires sustained execution. Any GLP-1 competitive pressure or FDA issues could trigger sharp repricing.",
      "Leverage: 3.8x debt/equity highest among quality names. Interest rate sensitivity if Fed policy shifts hawkish.",

      "Q4 2025 revenue (due Feb 2026) must exceed $18B with operating margin >42% to validate premium valuation vs Q3 baseline of 41%.",
      "Gross margin must stabilize above 82% vs 82.9% Q3. Any compression below 80% would signal pricing pressure or manufacturing inefficiency."
    ],
    "why_now": "Tech sector rotation creates entry point into defensive quality. NVDA's gross margin compression (73.4% down from 74%) and memory shortage concerns versus LLY's margin expansion (82.9% gross, 41% operating) with structural GLP-1 tailwind. Healthcare outperforming tech today (LLY +1.3% vs NVDA -3.2%) signals risk-off positioning favoring quality defensives. 30-day window captures Q4 earnings catalyst (due Feb 2026) where LLY can demonstrate GLP-1 franchise durability while tech faces margin pressure uncertainty."
