      "NVDA Q3 revenue +22% YoY to $57B with 73% gross margin vs AAPL's maturing iPhone cycle momentum",

    "why_now": "AAPL down 4.9% today signals momentum rotation out of consumer hardware into AI infrastructure. NVDA's 22% revenue growth and 64% FCF growth vs AAPL's 40% revenue comp (tough 2026 compare ahead) presents better risk-reward for next 30-day momentum play. Tech sector rotation favoring AI picks over consumer electronics into Feb earnings season."
