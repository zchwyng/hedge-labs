      "Strongest quality metrics among mega-caps: 48.8% operating margin, 30.5% ROE, consistent free cash flow generation ($10.4/share TTM)",
      "Cloud momentum intact with 14.6% operating income growth and stable margins despite AI spending. Less volatile than peers (down only 0.36% vs market selloff).",

      "If Azure revenue growth decelerates below 20% QoQ or operating margin falls below 45% in next quarter, thesis weakened",

MSFT demonstrating defensive characteristics (lowest daily decline) while maintaining strong fundamental momentum. 6-month window allows capture of continued cloud/AI monetization phase while avoiding overpaying for more speculative momentum names."
