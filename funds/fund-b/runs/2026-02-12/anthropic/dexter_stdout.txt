    "thesis": [
      "Dominant sector momentum: Energy (XLE) +20.8% YTD vs market -1.4%, XOM +8.3% in Feb alone demonstrating exceptional relative strength during market weakness",
      "Strong operational fundamentals: Q3 2025 revenue $85.3B (+4.6% YoY), operating margin 12.7%, consistent FCF generation $1.42/share with 56% payout ratio providing dividend safety",
      "Risk-off beneficiary: Large-cap energy provides defensive qualities with earnings resilience (EPS +7.7% YoY) and low PE 16.0x while tech leadership falters"
    ],
    "risks": [
      "Oil price volatility: Recent swings from $149+ to current levels create revenue uncertainty; commodity exposure limits predictability",
      "Sector rotation risk: Energy's outperformance may reverse if growth stocks regain favor or if recession fears drive broader commodity selloff",
      "Capital allocation pressure: High payout ratio 56% limits reinvestment flexibility; maintaining dividends through downturn could strain balance sheet"
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If XOM underperforms SPY by >5% over next 30 days or oil prices (WTI) fall below $65/barrel, exit position",
      "If operating margin falls below 10% for two consecutive quarters or FCF yield drops below 1%, reduce to <10%"
    ],
    "why_now": "Energy sector exhibiting rare combination of extreme relative strength (+22.2% vs SPY YTD), improving fundamentals (revenue +4.6%, EPS +7.7%), and defensive characteristics during market stress. Tech leadership breakdown (AAPL -5%, semiconductors weak) creates window for quality cyclical rotation. XOM's scale, dividend support (56% payout on strong FCF), and operational efficiency (12.7% OM) position it as defensive momentum play. 6-month catalyst path: Q4 earnings momentum, dividend increases, potential M&A activity, and continued flight-to-quality in volatile markets."
