      "Exceptional momentum: +19% YTD through Feb 12 ($134.14), vastly outperforming S&P 500; crossed $1T market cap milestone joining elite club",
      "Quality metrics improving: Q3 FY26 EPS $0.77 (inline), margin expansion evident with 24.9% gross margin; ROE 22.5%, defensive consumer staples positioning",

Entry at $134 provides cushion to $150+ price targets from analysts upgrading on consumer staples strength. Window closes if rotation back to tech accelerates or valuation multiple compresses."
