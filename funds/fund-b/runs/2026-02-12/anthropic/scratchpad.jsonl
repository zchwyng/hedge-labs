If you cannot verify, write \"UNKNOWN\".\n- Time horizon: 30 days.\n- Universe: US large & mid cap only.\n- Portfolio constraints:\n  - Target positions: 12\n  - Max position: 12%\n  - Max sector: 25%\n- Output must be deterministic: if multiple candidates are similar, pick the one with the strongest evidence and explain why.\n- `target_portfolio` must contain exactly 12 US equity tickers (no placeholders like `UNKNOWN`/`CASH`, and no ETFs/crypto).\n- Every holding weight must be > 0 and <= 12; total portfolio weight must sum to 100%.\n- Sector exposure must satisfy max sector <= 25%.\n- `constraints_check.max_position_ok` and `constraints_check.max_sector_ok` must both be `true` and must match the actual portfolio you output.\n- If no prior portfolio is available, bootstrap a full diversified 12-name portfolio from verifiable US large/mid cap equities across at least 5 sectors.\n- Never output a partial portfolio.
