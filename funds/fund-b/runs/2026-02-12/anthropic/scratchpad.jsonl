You must not give personal financial advice.\nYou are producing a research memo + a PAPER \"trade of the day\" candidate for comparison across models.\n\nRun metadata:\n- Run date: 2026-02-12\n- Fund name: Quality + Momentum (Monthly-hold)\n- Provider: anthropic\n- Model: claude-sonnet-4-5\n- Rebalance cadence: weekly\n\nRules:\n- Use only verifiable data you fetched via tools. If you cannot verify, write \"UNKNOWN\".\n- Time horizon: 30 days.\n- Universe: Global large/mid cap equities, focused ETFs (including commodities/metals), and major crypto assets.\n- Portfolio constraints:\n  - Target positions: 8\n  - Min position: 2%\n  - Max position: 40%\n  - Max sector: 80%\n  - Max crypto: 10%\n- Output must be deterministic: if multiple candidates are similar, pick the one with the strongest evidence and explain why.\n- `target_portfolio` must contain exactly 8 tradable symbols (equities, ETFs, or major crypto assets) with no placeholders like `UNKNOWN`/`CASH`.\n- Broad index ETFs are not allowed (for example: SPY, IVV, VOO, VTI, QQQ, IWM, DIA, VT, ACWI, EFA, EEM).\n- Commodity/metals ETFs and focused exposures are allowed (for example: GLD, IAU, SLV).\n- Every holding weight must be >= 2 and <= 40; total portfolio weight must sum to 100%.\n- Sector exposure must satisfy max sector <= 80%.\n- Crypto exposure (sum of holdings in sector \"Crypto\" or tickers like BTC-USD/ETH-USD) must be <= 10%.\n- `constraints_check.max_position_ok`, `constraints_check.max_sector_ok`, and `constraints_check.max_crypto_ok` must all be `true` and must match the actual portfolio you output.\n- You MUST call both `financial_search` and `financial_metrics` at least once before finalizing output.\n- If no prior portfolio is available, bootstrap a full 8-name high-conviction portfolio from verifiable equities, ETFs, and/or major crypto assets across at least 3 sectors/themes.\n- Never output a partial portfolio. Continue tool research until a valid full portfolio can be produced.\n- This is a true rebalance engine, not an idea list. Use prior portfolio context provided in the prompt and maintain state continuity.\n\nTasks:\n1) Portfolio Health Check (if a prior portfolio exists in repo for this fund):\n   - Summarize what changed in the last 24-72 hours: earnings, guidance, macro surprises, major news.\n   - List any holdings with \"thesis damage\" signals.\n\n2) PAPER TRADE OF THE DAY (candidate, NOT an instruction):\n   - Propose exactly ONE action among: [\"Add\", \"Trim\", \"Replace\", \"Do nothing\"].\n   - If \"Add\": set `add_ticker` to the added ticker.\n   - If \"Trim\": set `remove_ticker` to the trimmed ticker AND `add_ticker` to where weight is reallocated.\n   - If \"Replace\": specify which holding is removed and which is added.\n   - Also output `rebalance_actions`: full list of all rebalance actions taken this run.\n   - `trade_of_the_day` is the single headline action; `rebalance_actions` is the complete action list.\n   - On non-rebalance days, set `trade_of_the_day.action` to \"Do nothing\" and `rebalance_actions` to [].\n   - Provide: thesis (3 bullets), key risks (3 bullets), falsifiable checks (2), and why-now (6-18 months).\n   - Provide position sizing suggestion within constraints (e.g. +2% to target).\n\n3) Update the model portfolio (paper):\n   - Output the full target portfolio weights after today's action, respecting constraints.\n   - Include a constraints check.\n\nOutput ONLY JSON:\n{\n  \"run_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\n  \"fund_name\": \"\",\n  \"paper_only\": true,\n  \"market_summary\": [\"\", \"\", \"\"],\n  \"thesis_damage_flags\": [{\"ticker\":\"\",\"why\":\"\"}],\n  \"rebalance_actions\": [\n    {\"action\":\"Add|Trim|Replace|Do nothing\",\"remove_ticker\":null,\"add_ticker\":null,\"size_change_pct\":0}\n  ],\n  \"trade_of_the_day\": {\n    \"action\": \"Add|Trim|Replace|Do nothing\",\n    \"remove_ticker\": null,\n    \"add_ticker\": null,\n    \"size_change_pct\": 0,\n    \"thesis\": [\"\",\"\",\"\"],\n    \"risks\": [\"\",\"\",\"\"],\n    \"falsifiable_checks\": [\"\",\"\"],\n    \"why_now\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"target_portfolio\": [{\"ticker\":\"\",\"weight_pct\":0,\"sector\":\"\"}],\n  \"constraints_check\": {\"max_position_ok\": true, \"max_sector_ok\": true, \"max_crypto_ok\": true, \"notes\":\"\"}\n}\n\nStateful rebalance context (system-provided):\n- Prior successful run date: NONE\n- Days since prior successful run: N/A\n- Rebalance due today: true\n- Rebalance cadence minimum spacing (days): 7\n- Prior target_portfolio JSON: []\n- Prior trade_of_the_day JSON: {}\n- Last 7-day aggregated context JSON: {\"lookback_days\":7,\"successful_runs\":0,\"successful_run_dates\":[],\"action_history\":[],\"average_turnover_pct\":null,\"market_summary_bullets\":[],\"thesis_damage_counts\":[],\"recurring_holdings\":[]}\n\nExecution policy:\n- Treat prior target_portfolio as the starting portfolio when available.\n- If \"Rebalance due today\" is false, output action \"Do nothing\" and keep target_portfolio exactly unchanged.\n- If \"Rebalance due today\" is true, make only justified changes and keep turnover efficient.\n- On rebalance-due days, use the 7-day aggregated context explicitly when selecting actions and sizing.\n- On rebalance-due days, output full action list in `rebalance_actions` (can contain multiple actions).","timestamp":"2026-02-12T23:02:24.833Z"}
