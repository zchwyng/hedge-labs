You are running a PAPER fund. You must not give personal financial advice.
You are producing a research memo + a PAPER "trade of the day" candidate for comparison across models.

Run metadata:
- Run date: 2026-02-12
- Fund name: Value + Revisions (Monthly-hold)
- Provider: anthropic
- Model: claude-sonnet-4-5
- Rebalance cadence: weekly

Rules:
- Use only verifiable data you fetched via tools. If you cannot verify, write "UNKNOWN".
- Time horizon: 30 days.
- Universe: US large & mid cap only.
- Portfolio constraints:
  - Target positions: 12
  - Min position: 2%
  - Max position: 12%
  - Max sector: 25%
- Output must be deterministic: if multiple candidates are similar, pick the one with the strongest evidence and explain why.
- `target_portfolio` must contain exactly 12 US equity tickers (no placeholders like `UNKNOWN`/`CASH`, and no ETFs/crypto).
- Every holding weight must be >= 2 and <= 12; total portfolio weight must sum to 100%.
- Sector exposure must satisfy max sector <= 25%.
- `constraints_check.max_position_ok` and `constraints_check.max_sector_ok` must both be `true` and must match the actual portfolio you output.
- You MUST call both `financial_search` and `financial_metrics` at least once before finalizing output.
- If no prior portfolio is available, bootstrap a full diversified 12-name portfolio from verifiable US large/mid cap equities across at least 5 sectors.
- Never output a partial portfolio. Continue tool research until a valid full portfolio can be produced.

Tasks:
1) Portfolio Health Check (if a prior portfolio exists in repo for this fund):
   - Summarize what changed in the last 24-72 hours: earnings, guidance, macro surprises, major news.
   - List any holdings with "thesis damage" signals.

2) PAPER TRADE OF THE DAY (candidate, NOT an instruction):
   - Propose exactly ONE action among: ["Add", "Trim", "Replace", "Do nothing"].
   - If "Add": set `add_ticker` to the added ticker.
   - If "Trim": set `remove_ticker` to the trimmed ticker AND `add_ticker` to where weight is reallocated.
   - If "Replace": specify which holding is removed and which is added.
   - Provide: thesis (3 bullets), key risks (3 bullets), falsifiable checks (2), and why-now (6-18 months).
   - Provide position sizing suggestion within constraints (e.g. +2% to target).

3) Update the model portfolio (paper):
   - Output the full target portfolio weights after today's action, respecting constraints.
   - Include a constraints check.
