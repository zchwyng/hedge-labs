      "AI memory supercycle: MU revenue +49% YoY to $37.4B FY25, gross margin expansion to 39.8% from 22.4%, operating margin 27.1% vs 7.1% prior year—structural shift from commodity cyclicality to AI-driven demand",
      "Positioning ahead of Mag 7 capex: Tech giants planning $680B AI infrastructure spend in 2026; memory shortage narrative emerging as Cisco warned on margin pressure—MU uniquely exposed as memory supplier bottleneck",
      "Strong momentum + valuation disconnect: Stock up 8.8% in 10 days despite sector selloff; trading 16x P/E vs 46x NVDA, 25x MSFT—analysts highlight 'commodity multiple despite structural AI growth'; free cash flow inflection with $1.68B FCF (vs -$6B FY23)"
    ],
    "risks": [
      "Memory cycle volatility: Historical boom-bust pattern; FY23 posted -$5.8B net loss when cycle turned—investors fear repeat despite AI narrative",
      "Concentration risk: Heavy exposure to Mag 7 capex spending; if tech giants slow AI infrastructure build (like MSFT downgrade concerns), MU revenue hits immediately",
      "Valuation stretched on absolute basis: $415 price represents 3.7x sales vs 2.5x book; if memory shortage narrative fails or AI capex disappoints, momentum reverses sharply"
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "MU quarterly earnings (next: Q2 FY26 likely March 2026): Revenue growth >15% QoQ, gross margin sustained >38%, guidance confirms memory shortage persisting into H2 2026",
      "Mag 7 capex execution: Track MSFT/META/GOOGL quarterly capex disclosures through Q1 2026—if aggregate AI infrastructure spend decelerates below $150B quarterly run rate, thesis weakens"
    ],
    "why_now": "Market pricing in tech weakness creates entry: Feb 12 selloff took AAPL -5.1%, NVDA -3.3%, META -3.0% on memory shortage fears, yet MU relatively outperformed at -1.6% intraday. Memory shortage is a supply bottleneck that benefits MU as the critical infrastructure provider. Wall Street just caught on—Goldman highlighted 7 memory stocks, analyst articles flooding in Feb 11-12 on 'memory supercycle' thesis. Positioning before March quarter earnings when guidance will likely confirm structural tightness lasting 6-18 months as AI accelerator deployments ramp."
