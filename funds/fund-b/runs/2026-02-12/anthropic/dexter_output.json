    "Strong jobs report on Feb 12 drove equity gains, S&P 500 and Dow futures advanced after strong employment data",

      "Strong momentum with +15.1% gain since Feb 2 ($690.91 to $758.57), breaking above $750 resistance on heavy volume, indicating institutional accumulation",
      "Defensive industrial exposure with infrastructure tailwinds: global construction recovery, US infrastructure spending, and China stimulus measures driving equipment demand",
      "Attractive valuation support at PE 29.6 vs historical premium, 5.7% EPS growth, strong FCF generation ($18.30/share) with 0.18 payout ratio leaving room for capital deployment"
    ],
    "risks": [
      "Recent 15% rally may face near-term consolidation or profit-taking, especially if broader industrial sector rotates",
      "High debt-to-equity ratio (5.4x) creates vulnerability to rising interest rates or recession scenario",
      "Revenue growth deceleration risk if China stimulus disappoints or US construction activity slows"
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "Price maintains above $740 support through Feb; sustained break below signals momentum exhaustion",
      "Q1 2026 earnings (late April) must show revenue growth acceleration above 0.7% YoY and operating margin expansion to validate current valuation"
    ],
    "why_now": "CAT exhibits classic value-with-momentum setup: 15% breakout after multi-month consolidation coinciding with macro catalysts (infrastructure spending cycle, China stimulus). The stock trades at a discount to typical cyclical peak multiples while showing positive earnings revisions. Entry now captures momentum before Q1 earnings catalyst while maintaining 6-month horizon to ride infrastructure cycle acceleration through mid-2026."
