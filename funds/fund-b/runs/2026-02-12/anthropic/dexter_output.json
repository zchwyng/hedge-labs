      "Highest quality-adjusted value in Financials: PE 13.1x vs peers (JPM 14.7x, WFC 13.2x, GS 16.7x) with 9.7% ROE and 7.4% EPS growth",
      "Strong free cash flow generation with FCF yield of 15.8% and $8.30 FCF/share, significantly above sector peers",
      "Earnings momentum improving: 5.6% earnings growth acceleration vs prior year, strongest among large cap banks in verified data"
    ],
    "risks": [
      "High debt-to-equity at 2.33x reflects banking leverage model; interest rate sensitivity on net interest margin",
      "Today's 2.56% selloff part of broader financials rotation; near-term volatility if sector weakness persists",
      "Payout ratio of 32% limits dividend upside; capital allocation heavily weighted toward buybacks rather than yield"
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "Q1 2026 earnings (April release) must show NIM stability or expansion vs Q4 2025 to validate thesis",
      "FCF/share must remain above $7.50 for next 2 quarters to confirm sustainable cash generation"
    ],
    "why_now": "Recent 2.6% pullback creates entry point at 13.1x PE with 15.8% FCF yield, well below historical average. Banking sector facing indiscriminate selling despite BAC's improving fundamentals (7.4% EPS growth vs 3.8% for JPM). 30-day horizon captures Q1 earnings in April where positive NIM trends should drive re-rating. Quality/value combination strongest in verified large-cap universe."
