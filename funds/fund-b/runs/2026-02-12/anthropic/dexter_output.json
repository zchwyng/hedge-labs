    "why_now": "TSM offers superior quality (60% gross margin) at reasonable valuation (28 P/E, 0.24 PEG) during tech sector dislocation. While peers face margin pressure (NVDA -7.5% MTD, AMD -17.8%), TSM is up 8.3% MTD on defensive positioning. 6-18 month catalyst: AI infrastructure buildout favors leading-edge capacity (TSM 3nm monopoly), Apple/NVDA refresh cycles in H2 2026, and potential geopolitical premium if Taiwan tensions ease post-US election cycle. Current selloff provides entry at 2024 valuation despite 2025 earnings upgrade cycle."
