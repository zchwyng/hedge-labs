      "Attractive valuation: P/E 28.7x with 6.6% EPS growth, PEG 4.3x; EV/EBITDA 21.1x reasonable for 32% ROE and 40% operating margin",
      "Positive earnings revisions: Consensus EPS rising from $11.43 (2026) to $13.24 (2027) to $15.08 (2028) — 16% and 14% annual growth",

    "why_now": "GOOGL trades at a discount to peers (P/E 28.7x vs META 27.1x, AAPL 33.2x, AMZN 27.3x) despite superior margins (40% operating vs 32% AAPL, 14% AMZN) and balance sheet (0.14x debt/equity, $6.07 FCF/share). Today's relative outperformance during a risk-off session suggests rotation into quality value. Analyst estimates show consistent upward trajectory. 6-18 month catalyst: continued AI integration into search/cloud monetization and potential resolution of regulatory uncertainty."
