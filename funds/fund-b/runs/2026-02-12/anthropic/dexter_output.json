      "Best-in-class quality: 54% ROE, 61% operating margin, 50% net margin - elite profitability metrics across all sectors",
      "Stable growth with momentum: 11% revenue growth, consistent earnings execution, P/E 28.6x reasonable vs quality profile",

      "Payment networks face secular headwinds from BNPL, crypto, and direct bank-to-bank transfers reducing interchange dependency",

      "Q2 FY2026 (Mar 2026) revenue must exceed $12.2B (10%+ YoY growth) to maintain growth trajectory",

    ],
    "why_now": "Quality + Momentum strategy needs defensive positioning amid tech volatility. V offers rare combination: 54% ROE ranks #1 vs all candidates, positive price momentum intact despite -0.91% today, and payment volumes accelerating into spring travel/retail season. 30-day holding period captures Q2 earnings (late April) as catalyst. Current 28.6x P/E vs 31.7x historical average provides entry discount."
