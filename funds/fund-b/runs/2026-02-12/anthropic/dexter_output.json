      "Strong fundamental quality: JPM delivered Q3 EPS $5.07 (+2.7% YoY), Q2 EPS $5.24, Q1 EPS $5.07, all beating $5. ROE 15.7%, net margin 31.6%, operating margin 39.8%. Asset-light financials model with dominant market position.",
      "Attractive valuation on weakness: P/E 14.6x vs 5-year avg ~12-15x, P/B 2.29x. Feb 12 selloff (-3.59%) creates entry at $301 vs recent highs. Trading below tech multiples despite comparable quality metrics.",
      "Positive estimate revisions catalyst: Q3 beat consensus, raised NII guidance. Analyst targets avg $230-250 imply upside. Rising rate environment into 2026 benefits NIM expansion. Payout ratio 28% supports 4.7% div + buybacks."
    ],
    "risks": [
      "Rate cycle reversal: If Fed cuts rates faster than expected in 2H 2026, NIM compression could pressure earnings. Interest rate sensitivity is primary macro risk.",
      "Credit cycle deterioration: Consumer loan delinquencies or commercial real estate stress could require reserve builds, impacting EPS. Monitor charge-off trends quarterly.",
      "Regulatory overhang: Basel III endgame capital requirements or new bank regulations could constrain capital return or ROE. Political risk into 2026 elections."
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "Q4 2025 (Jan 2026 report): EPS must exceed $4.80 and NII guidance must be maintained or raised. Any reserve build >$2B or credit deterioration is exit signal.",
      "Price target: If JPM trades below $280 for 3 consecutive days without macro shock, or fails to hold $290 support after earnings, reassess thesis."
    ],
    "why_now": "Financial sector selloff on Feb 12 (JPM -3.59%, sector avg -3-4%) creates tactical entry into highest-quality US bank. Q3 earnings beat + guidance raise + 30-day window for estimate revisions to flow through. Value rotation theme emerging per Goldman research. 6-month catalyst path: Q4 earnings (mid-Jan), Fed policy clarity (Mar FOMC), potential multiple re-rating if rates stabilize. Downside protected by 2.3x P/B vs tangible book, dividend yield, and fortress balance sheet."
