      "Cheapest large-cap financial at 13.1x P/E vs sector avg ~17x, trading at 1.27x book value - significant discount for improving fundamentals",

    "why_now": "BAC combines compelling valuation (cheapest mega-cap bank), positive earnings revisions (56bps EPS growth accelerating vs flat YoY sector), and technical oversold conditions after -3.3% single-day drop. 30-day window captures Q1 earnings catalyst in April while capturing mean reversion in oversold financials. Market overreacting to rate concerns - BAC's diversified revenue streams (investment banking, wealth management, trading) provide insulation vs pure NII exposure."
