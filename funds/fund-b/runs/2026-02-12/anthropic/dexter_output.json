      "Deep value at P/E 56x on depressed earnings, but analyst estimates show EPS recovery to $7.12 (2026) → $8.11 (2027) → $9.32 (2028), implying forward P/E of ~11x on 2026E",

Analysts turning constructive with multiple upgrade catalysts identified. The massive earnings growth trajectory ($1.39 TTM → $7.12 est) represents a normalization play after 2025's impairments. At 0.25x P/S and 7.8% FCF yield, downside appears limited while upside to fair value is substantial as healthcare cost pressures stabilize."
