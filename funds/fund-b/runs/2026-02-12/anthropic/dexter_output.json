      "Explosive earnings growth: Q1 FY26 EPS of $4.60 vs $1.41 year-ago; revenue up 69% YoY to $13.6B with 56% gross margin",
      "Attractive valuation with strong revisions: Forward P/E ~13x on FY26 consensus EPS of $32.04, rising to $42.30 in FY27 (+32% growth); PEG ratio of ~1.0",

    ],
    "why_now": "MU trades at ~39x trailing P/E but only ~13x forward on FY26 estimates, reflecting massive earnings inflection. Consensus EPS revisions have been sharply positive (FY27 at $42+ implies 32% growth). The stock pulled back on Monday providing entry opportunity. Memory supercycle driven by AI infrastructure buildout has 12-18 month runway as hyperscalers execute on $680B capex plans. Value + Revisions strategy captures both the discount to intrinsic value and positive estimate momentum."
