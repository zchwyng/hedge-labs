    "why_now": "Day 2 of weekly hold period following February 12 rebalance. Current 48-hour price action shows portfolio working as constructed: gold providing exceptional hedge (+2.49% today, offsetting tech weakness), energy consolidating recent leadership (XOM/CVX flat to +1% range), quality growth compounders stable (LLY +0.31%, JPM flat). Single-name weakness in AVGO (-1.81%) is normal volatility within 10% position size, not thesis break. Next rebalance window (Feb 19-20) allows full weekly momentum/quality rescoring across candidate universe. Premature action would sacrifice transaction cost efficiency for reactive position management. Portfolio remains positioned for 6-12 month themes: energy leadership continuation, defensive positioning via gold, quality compounders in healthcare/financials, selective tech exposure through KLAC/AVGO."
