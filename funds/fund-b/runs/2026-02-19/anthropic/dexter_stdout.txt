Wednesday session showing strong performance: energy sector delivering exceptional gains (XOM +3.28% to $150.68, CVX +1.91% to $183.87) on commodity momentum, gold rebounding +2.25% to $458.28 and recovering above prior $448 consolidation level, quality compounders mixed but stable (JPM +0.50%, LLY -1.60% contained), tech holdings constructive (AVGO +0.27% to $333.51 maintaining $28.51 cushion above $305 emergency trigger, KLAC +0.61%). Broader market confirming risk-on tone with SPY +0.50%, QQQ +0.68%. No holdings breaching falsifiable invalidation thresholds. Premature action would sacrifice transaction cost efficiency and systematic process discipline for reactive position management during normal portfolio performance. Optimal trade path remains completion of current weekly hold period, then systematic rebalance February 26 with full momentum/quality rescoring across expanded candidate universe. Portfolio delivering as constructed: energy providing alpha, gold hedge functioning, quality compounders stable, tech positioned for continued strength."
