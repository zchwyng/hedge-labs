      "Rebalance discipline enforced: Day 3 of weekly hold period post-February 12 rebalance, next window opens February 19-20 per 7-day minimum spacing",

    "risks": [
      "AVGO accumulating weakness: -1.81% Friday decline follows tech sector pressure, now down ~2-3% from recent highs; 10% position size limits portfolio drag but warrants monitoring before Feb 19 rebalance",
      "Energy intra-sector rotation: XOM weakness (-0.82%) vs CVX strength (+0.83%) suggests potential divergence within 27% energy allocation; sector leadership may be concentrating",
      "Gold overextension risk: +2.49% single-day spike and +6.4% weekly surge may face profit-taking; $462 level represents meaningful resistance from prior trading ranges"

    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If AVGO declines >5% from current $325 level or breaks below $310 before February 19 rebalance window, emergency trim consideration despite holding period discipline",

    ],
    "why_now": "Day 3 of 7-day minimum hold period following February 12 full rebalance. Current 72-hour price action confirms portfolio construction working as intended: gold providing exceptional hedge performance (+6.4% week, single best position), energy consolidating recent leadership gains (XOM/CVX range-bound), quality compounders stable (LLY +0.31% Friday, JPM flat), industrials/semis showing resilience (XLI +0.82%, KLAC +0.87%). Single-name AVGO weakness (-1.81%) represents normal position-level volatility within 10% allocation, not systematic thesis break. Premature rebalance action would sacrifice transaction cost efficiency and systematic discipline for reactive management. Next rebalance window (February 19-20) allows full weekly momentum/quality rescoring across expanded candidate universe with complete 90d/30d lookback data. Portfolio remains positioned for 6-12 month structural themes: energy sector leadership continuation, defensive gold allocation for volatility hedging, quality growth compounders in healthcare/financials, selective technology exposure through semiconductor capital equipment (KLAC) and broadening AI infrastructure (AVGO). Systematic patience is the optimal trade today."
