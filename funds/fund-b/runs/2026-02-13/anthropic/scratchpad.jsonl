You must not give personal financial advice.\nYou are producing a research memo + a PAPER \"trade of the day\" candidate for comparison across models.\n\nRun metadata:\n- Run date: 2026-02-13\n- Fund name: Quality + Momentum (Monthly-hold)\n- Provider: anthropic\n- Model: claude-sonnet-4-5\n- Rebalance cadence: weekly\n\nRules:\n- Use only verifiable data you fetched via tools. If you cannot verify, write \"UNKNOWN\".\n- Time horizon: 30 days.\n- Universe: Global large/mid cap equities, focused ETFs (including commodities/metals), and major crypto assets.\n- Tooling best practices (important to avoid rate limits and preserve data quality):\n  - Prefer `financial_search` as your primary tool. Call `financial_search` ONCE with a single, complete query.\n  - Do NOT do broad scanning (no 25-50 ticker lists). Limit any tool query to <= 12 tickers total.\n  - Only fetch fundamentals/ratios for the tickers you are actually considering for the final portfolio (ideally the final 8).\n  - Avoid requesting `get_company_facts`, full financial statements, or lots of news unless absolutely necessary.\n  - If you include news, cap it to <= 4 tickers and avoid news for index/sector ETFs.\n  - Use snapshot endpoints when possible (current price snapshot, key ratios snapshot) instead of long ranges.\n- Portfolio constraints:\n  - Target positions: 8\n  - Min position: 2%\n  - Max position: 40%\n  - Max sector: 80%\n  - Max crypto: 10%\n- Output must be deterministic: if multiple candidates are similar, pick the one with the strongest evidence and explain why.\n- `target_portfolio` must contain exactly 8 tradable symbols (equities, ETFs, or major crypto assets) with no placeholders like `UNKNOWN`/`CASH`.\n- Broad index ETFs are not allowed (for example: SPY, IVV, VOO, VTI, QQQ, IWM, DIA, VT, ACWI, EFA, EEM).\n- Commodity/metals ETFs and focused exposures are allowed (for example: GLD, IAU, SLV).\n- Every holding weight must be >= 2 and <= 40; total portfolio weight must sum to 100%.\n- Sector exposure must satisfy max sector <= 80%.\n- Crypto exposure (sum of holdings in sector \"Crypto\" or tickers like BTC-USD/ETH-USD) must be <= 10%.\n- `constraints_check.max_position_ok`, `constraints_check.max_sector_ok`, and `constraints_check.max_crypto_ok` must all be `true` and must match the actual portfolio you output.\n- You MUST call `financial_search` at least once before finalizing output. Call `financial_metrics` only if you truly need it.\n- If no prior portfolio is available, bootstrap a full 8-name high-conviction portfolio from verifiable equities, ETFs, and/or major crypto assets across at least 3 sectors/themes.\n- Never output a partial portfolio. Continue tool research until a valid full portfolio can be produced.\n- This is a true rebalance engine, not an idea list. Use prior portfolio context provided in the prompt and maintain state continuity.\n\nTasks:\n1) Portfolio Health Check (if a prior portfolio exists in repo for this fund):\n   - Summarize what changed in the last 24-72 hours: earnings, guidance, macro surprises, major news.\n   - List any holdings with \"thesis damage\" signals.\n\nPre-step (before calling tools):\n- Decide on a plausible candidate 8-name portfolio first (tickers + rough weights + sectors) based on your model priors and the stateful context.\n- Then use tools to verify only what you need for those candidates (do not expand the ticker list).\n\n2) PAPER TRADE OF THE DAY (candidate, NOT an instruction):\n   - Propose exactly ONE action among: [\"Add\", \"Trim\", \"Replace\", \"Do nothing\"].\n   - If \"Add\": set `add_ticker` to the added ticker.\n   - If \"Trim\": set `remove_ticker` to the trimmed ticker AND `add_ticker` to where weight is reallocated.\n   - If \"Replace\": specify which holding is removed and which is added.\n   - Also output `rebalance_actions`: full list of all rebalance actions taken this run.\n   - `trade_of_the_day` is the single headline action; `rebalance_actions` is the complete action list.\n   - On non-rebalance days, set `trade_of_the_day.action` to \"Do nothing\" and `rebalance_actions` to [].\n   - Provide: thesis (3 bullets), key risks (3 bullets), falsifiable checks (2), and why-now (6-18 months).\n   - Provide position sizing suggestion within constraints (e.g. +2% to target).\n\n3) Update the model portfolio (paper):\n   - Output the full target portfolio weights after today's action, respecting constraints.\n   - Include a constraints check.\n\nOutput ONLY JSON:\n{\n  \"run_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\n  \"fund_name\": \"\",\n  \"paper_only\": true,\n  \"market_summary\": [\"\", \"\", \"\"],\n  \"thesis_damage_flags\": [{\"ticker\":\"\",\"why\":\"\"}],\n  \"rebalance_actions\": [\n    {\"action\":\"Add|Trim|Replace|Do nothing\",\"remove_ticker\":null,\"add_ticker\":null,\"size_change_pct\":0}\n  ],\n  \"trade_of_the_day\": {\n    \"action\": \"Add|Trim|Replace|Do nothing\",\n    \"remove_ticker\": null,\n    \"add_ticker\": null,\n    \"size_change_pct\": 0,\n    \"thesis\": [\"\",\"\",\"\"],\n    \"risks\": [\"\",\"\",\"\"],\n    \"falsifiable_checks\": [\"\",\"\"],\n    \"why_now\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"target_portfolio\": [{\"ticker\":\"\",\"weight_pct\":0,\"sector\":\"\"}],\n  \"constraints_check\": {\"max_position_ok\": true, \"max_sector_ok\": true, \"max_crypto_ok\": true, \"notes\":\"\"}\n}\n\nStateful rebalance context (system-provided):\n- Prior successful run date: 2026-02-12\n- Days since prior successful run: 1\n- Rebalance due today: false\n- Rebalance cadence minimum spacing (days): 7\n- Prior target_portfolio JSON: [{\"ticker\":\"XOM\",\"weight_pct\":15,\"sector\":\"Energy\"},{\"ticker\":\"CVX\",\"weight_pct\":12,\"sector\":\"Energy\"},{\"ticker\":\"LLY\",\"weight_pct\":12,\"sector\":\"Healthcare\"},{\"ticker\":\"JPM\",\"weight_pct\":12,\"sector\":\"Financials\"},{\"ticker\":\"XLI\",\"weight_pct\":11,\"sector\":\"Industrials\"},{\"ticker\":\"KLAC\",\"weight_pct\":10,\"sector\":\"Technology\"},{\"ticker\":\"AVGO\",\"weight_pct\":10,\"sector\":\"Technology\"},{\"ticker\":\"GLD\",\"weight_pct\":18,\"sector\":\"Commodities\"}]\n- Prior trade_of_the_day JSON: {\"action\":\"Add\",\"remove_ticker\":null,\"add_ticker\":\"XOM\",\"size_change_pct\":15,\"thesis\":[\"Dominant sector momentum: Energy (XLE) +20.8% YTD vs market -1.4%, XOM +8.3% in Feb alone demonstrating exceptional relative strength during market weakness\",\"Strong operational fundamentals: Q3 2025 revenue $85.3B (+4.6% YoY), operating margin 12.7%, consistent FCF generation $1.42/share with 56% payout ratio providing dividend safety\",\"Risk-off beneficiary: Large-cap energy provides defensive qualities with earnings resilience (EPS +7.7% YoY) and low PE 16.0x while tech leadership falters\"],\"risks\":[\"Oil price volatility: Recent swings from $149+ to current levels create revenue uncertainty; commodity exposure limits predictability\",\"Sector rotation risk: Energy's outperformance may reverse if growth stocks regain favor or if recession fears drive broader commodity selloff\",\"Capital allocation pressure: High payout ratio 56% limits reinvestment flexibility; maintaining dividends through downturn could strain balance sheet\"],\"falsifiable_checks\":[\"If XOM underperforms SPY by >5% over next 30 days or oil prices (WTI) fall below $65/barrel, exit position\",\"If operating margin falls below 10% for two consecutive quarters or FCF yield drops below 1%, reduce to <10%\"],\"why_now\":\"Energy sector exhibiting rare combination of extreme relative strength (+22.2% vs SPY YTD), improving fundamentals (revenue +4.6%, EPS +7.7%), and defensive characteristics during market stress.
