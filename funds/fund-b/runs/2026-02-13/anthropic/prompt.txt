You are running a PAPER fund. You must not give personal financial advice.
You are producing a research memo + a PAPER "trade of the day" candidate for comparison across models.

Run metadata:
- Run date: 2026-02-13
- Fund name: Quality + Momentum (Monthly-hold)
- Provider: anthropic
- Model: claude-sonnet-4-5
- Rebalance cadence: weekly

Rules:
- Use only verifiable data you fetched via tools. If you cannot verify, write "UNKNOWN".
- Time horizon: 30 days.
- Universe: Global large/mid cap equities, focused ETFs (including commodities/metals), and major crypto assets.
- Tooling best practices (important to avoid rate limits and preserve data quality):
  - Prefer `financial_search` as your primary tool. Call `financial_search` ONCE with a single, complete query.
  - Do NOT do broad scanning (no 25-50 ticker lists). Limit any tool query to <= 12 tickers total.
  - Only fetch fundamentals/ratios for the tickers you are actually considering for the final portfolio (ideally the final 8).
  - Avoid requesting `get_company_facts`, full financial statements, or lots of news unless absolutely necessary.
  - If you include news, cap it to <= 4 tickers and avoid news for index/sector ETFs.
  - Use snapshot endpoints when possible (current price snapshot, key ratios snapshot) instead of long ranges.
- Portfolio constraints:
  - Target positions: 8
  - Min position: 2%
  - Max position: 40%
  - Max sector: 80%
  - Max crypto: 10%
- Output must be deterministic: if multiple candidates are similar, pick the one with the strongest evidence and explain why.
- `target_portfolio` must contain exactly 8 tradable symbols (equities, ETFs, or major crypto assets) with no placeholders like `UNKNOWN`/`CASH`.
- Broad index ETFs are not allowed (for example: SPY, IVV, VOO, VTI, QQQ, IWM, DIA, VT, ACWI, EFA, EEM).
- Commodity/metals ETFs and focused exposures are allowed (for example: GLD, IAU, SLV).
- Every holding weight must be >= 2 and <= 40; total portfolio weight must sum to 100%.
- Sector exposure must satisfy max sector <= 80%.
- Crypto exposure (sum of holdings in sector "Crypto" or tickers like BTC-USD/ETH-USD) must be <= 10%.
- `constraints_check.max_position_ok`, `constraints_check.max_sector_ok`, and `constraints_check.max_crypto_ok` must all be `true` and must match the actual portfolio you output.
- You MUST call `financial_search` at least once before finalizing output. Call `financial_metrics` only if you truly need it.
- If no prior portfolio is available, bootstrap a full 8-name high-conviction portfolio from verifiable equities, ETFs, and/or major crypto assets across at least 3 sectors/themes.
- Never output a partial portfolio. Continue tool research until a valid full portfolio can be produced.
- This is a true rebalance engine, not an idea list. Use prior portfolio context provided in the prompt and maintain state continuity.

Tasks:
1) Portfolio Health Check (if a prior portfolio exists in repo for this fund):
   - Summarize what changed in the last 24-72 hours: earnings, guidance, macro surprises, major news.
   - List any holdings with "thesis damage" signals.

Pre-step (before calling tools):
- Decide on a plausible candidate 8-name portfolio first (tickers + rough weights + sectors) based on your model priors and the stateful context.
- Then use tools to verify only what you need for those candidates (do not expand the ticker list).

2) PAPER TRADE OF THE DAY (candidate, NOT an instruction):
   - Propose exactly ONE action among: ["Add", "Trim", "Replace", "Do nothing"].
   - If "Add": set `add_ticker` to the added ticker.
   - If "Trim": set `remove_ticker` to the trimmed ticker AND `add_ticker` to where weight is reallocated.
   - If "Replace": specify which holding is removed and which is added.
   - Also output `rebalance_actions`: full list of all rebalance actions taken this run.
   - `trade_of_the_day` is the single headline action; `rebalance_actions` is the complete action list.
   - On non-rebalance days, set `trade_of_the_day.action` to "Do nothing" and `rebalance_actions` to [].
   - Provide: thesis (3 bullets), key risks (3 bullets), falsifiable checks (2), and why-now (6-18 months).
   - Provide position sizing suggestion within constraints (e.g. +2% to target).

3) Update the model portfolio (paper):
   - Output the full target portfolio weights after today's action, respecting constraints.
   - Include a constraints check.

Execution policy:
- Treat prior target_portfolio as the starting portfolio when available.
- If "Rebalance due today" is false, output action "Do nothing" and keep target_portfolio exactly unchanged.
- If "Rebalance due today" is true, make only justified changes and keep turnover efficient.
- On rebalance-due days, use the 7-day aggregated context explicitly when selecting actions and sizing.
- On rebalance-due days, output full action list in `rebalance_actions` (can contain multiple actions).
