    "Equities mixed intraday: SPY -0.18%, QQQ flat, reflecting muted trading volume and consolidation after prior session weakness",

      "Portfolio rebalance not due: Weekly cadence requires 7-day spacing; last rebalance executed 2026-02-12, only 1 day elapsed",
      "Current holdings show stability: All 8 positions trading flat to positive intraday with no material news or earnings releases creating thesis damage",
      "Strategic positioning intact: Energy overweight (27%), defensive commodities exposure (18% GLD), and quality growth allocation (Technology 20%, Healthcare 12%, Financials 12%) aligned with risk-off environment"
    ],
    "risks": [
      "Energy concentration risk: 27% combined XOM+CVX exposure vulnerable to oil price reversal if demand concerns emerge or OPEC+ increases supply",
      "Gold position size: 18% GLD allocation near maximum single-position limit reduces portfolio flexibility for other defensive additions",
      "Tech sector weakness: KLAC and AVGO remain exposed to semiconductor cycle concerns and memory pricing pressure despite quality characteristics"
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If portfolio underperforms SPY by >3% over next 7 days or energy sector (XLE) gives back >5% of YTD gains, reassess energy overweight",
      "If GLD breaks below $440 (3% decline) or 10-year Treasury yield rises above 4.5%, reduce commodities exposure below 15%"
    ],
    "why_now": "Maintaining discipline on weekly rebalance cadence preserves transaction cost efficiency and avoids overtrading on intraday noise. Current portfolio construction delivered strong relative performance during prior session market weakness, with energy leadership (+0.25% avg today) and gold strength (+0.72%) offsetting modest equity market pressure. All holdings trade with normal volume and no material catalysts warrant early rebalancing. Next scheduled review 2026-02-19 will reassess positioning with 7 days of performance data and any interim earnings/macro developments."
