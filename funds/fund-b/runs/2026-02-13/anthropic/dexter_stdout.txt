    "Markets consolidating after yesterday's decline: SPY and major indices trading in narrow ranges ahead of January CPI data release",

      "Rebalance cadence discipline: Weekly rebalance schedule requires 7-day minimum spacing; only 1 day elapsed since 2026-02-12 rebalance",
      "Portfolio structure intact: Energy momentum thesis continues with XOM/CVX stable, quality holdings (LLY, JPM) resilient, defensive gold allocation performing as designed",
      "No material thesis damage: Holdings trading within normal volatility ranges with no adverse earnings surprises or macro shocks requiring immediate action"

    "risks": [
      "January CPI volatility: Today's inflation data could trigger sharp market moves affecting all holdings if significantly different from consensus",
      "Energy momentum exhaustion: Sector has outperformed dramatically; any oil price weakness or profit-taking could reverse recent gains quickly",

    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If portfolio underperforms SPY by >3% over next 7 days before next rebalance window, reassess energy sector concentration",

    ],
    "why_now": "Maintaining rebalance discipline is critical for systematic strategy execution. Portfolio added XOM yesterday as quality energy momentum play and structure remains sound with 27% energy, 20% tech, 18% commodities providing balanced exposure to current market regime. Next rebalance window opens 2026-02-19, allowing full week to assess CPI impact, energy sustainability, and any emerging opportunities without overtrading."
