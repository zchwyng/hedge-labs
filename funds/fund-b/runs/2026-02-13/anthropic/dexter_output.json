      "Rebalance cadence discipline: Weekly rebalance cycle maintains 7-day minimum spacing to avoid overtrading and preserve momentum signals",

    "why_now": "Systematic rebalance discipline prevents reactionary trading during normal market volatility. Yesterday's portfolio construction (Feb 12) reflects deliberate quality+momentum positioning with energy/defensive tilt. Current 24-hour price action shows no material thesis breaks - energy consolidating, gold working as intended, quality growth (LLY) advancing. Next rebalance window (Feb 19-20) allows full weekly momentum/quality rescoring across 8-12 candidate universe. Patience preserves transaction cost efficiency and avoids whipsaw during intraday noise. Portfolio remains positioned for 6-month themes: energy leadership continuation, flight-to-quality in volatility, quality growth compounders in healthcare/tech."
