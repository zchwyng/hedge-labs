      "Rebalance cadence: Weekly rebalance executed yesterday (2026-02-12), next rebalance due 2026-02-19 per 7-day minimum spacing policy",

    "why_now": "No action warranted - portfolio executed full 8-position rebalance yesterday (2026-02-12) per weekly cadence. Current holdings demonstrate thesis validation: energy momentum persists (CVX Libya contract win, dividend ETF recognition), healthcare stable (LLY GLP-1 competition news neutral), financials/industrials defensive, tech stabilizing post-selloff. Next rebalance window opens 2026-02-19, allowing 7-day minimum spacing for momentum signals to develop and avoiding unnecessary turnover during consolidation period."
