      "Weekly rebalance cadence not met: Only 1 day since prior successful run on 2026-02-12, minimum 7-day spacing required",
      "Portfolio experiencing normal volatility: All holdings down except LLY reflects broad market weakness, not thesis breaks",
      "Maintain discipline: Single-day moves insufficient to trigger changes; energy momentum and quality factors remain intact structurally"
    ],
    "risks": [
      "Momentum reversal risk: Energy's -3.55% (XOM) and -1.84% (CVX) may signal trend exhaustion after strong YTD gains",
      "Concentration pressure: 18% GLD position declining -3.47% creates outsized portfolio drag during broader risk-off",
      "Tech exposure vulnerability: AVGO -3.41%, KLAC -1.90% continue sector weakness amid semiconductor concerns"
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If XOM declines another -5% from current $149.93 or underperforms SPY by >8% cumulative over next 5 trading days, reassess energy thesis",
      "If GLD falls below $440 (additional -2.5%) while VIX remains elevated, consider defensive positioning failure"
    ],
    "why_now": "Rebalance cadence discipline prevents overtrading on single-day volatility. Portfolio constructed for 6-18 month quality + momentum thesis requires minimum 7-day holding periods to avoid whipsaw. Current drawdown (-1.5% to -3.5% across most holdings) reflects market-wide pressure rather than idiosyncratic thesis damage. LLY's +2.30% resilience validates quality healthcare exposure. Next review in 6 days will assess whether energy momentum persists or requires tactical adjustment."
