      "Rebalance cadence discipline: Weekly rebalance schedule requires 7-day minimum spacing; only 1 day since last rebalance (2026-02-12)",
      "Portfolio stability maintained: All holdings trading flat to slightly positive (XOM +0.15%, GLD +0.59%), no material price dislocations or thesis violations observed",
      "News flow supportive: Energy names showing continued positive analyst commentary (CVX Libya win, XOM trillion-club trajectory), LLY weight-loss inventory build signals FDA approval confidence, no negative catalysts identified"
    ],
    "risks": [
      "Premature action risk: Making changes before scheduled rebalance window violates disciplined cadence and increases trading costs without strategic justification",
      "Momentum decay: Energy sector's exceptional YTD performance (+20.8% XLE) may be vulnerable to mean reversion if oil prices weaken or growth stocks regain favor",
      "Concentration exposure: Energy 27% weight (XOM 15% + CVX 12%) creates sector concentration risk if commodity prices reverse sharply"

    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If any holding drops >5% intraday or major negative news (earnings miss, guidance cut, regulatory action) emerges before next rebalance window, reassess immediately",

    "why_now": "Non-rebalance day per weekly cadence discipline. Portfolio constructed yesterday (2026-02-12) continues to exhibit quality + momentum characteristics with no material deterioration. Energy leadership (XOM/CVX), defensive gold allocation (GLD 18%), and diversified quality exposure (LLY healthcare, JPM financials, tech via KLAC/AVGO, industrials via XLI) remain aligned with fund mandate. Next rebalance window opens 2026-02-19 (7 days post last rebalance). Today's action: monitor for thesis damage signals, maintain existing allocations, preserve capital for next strategic adjustment window."
