      "Rebalance cadence not met: Weekly rebalance policy requires 7-day minimum spacing; only 1 day has passed since prior successful run on 2026-02-12",

    "risks": [
      "Energy mean reversion risk: XOM/CVX combined 27% exposure vulnerable if oil prices correct or sector rotation accelerates away from commodities",
      "Concentration risk: GLD at 18% (near 40% single-position limit) creates outsized sensitivity to gold price movements and Fed policy shifts",

      "If any holding declines >8% vs SPY over next 7 days, flag for replacement consideration at next weekly rebalance",

    "why_now": "No action warranted today due to weekly rebalance cadence requiring 7-day minimum spacing. Prior portfolio established 2026-02-12 remains valid with no thesis damage signals in 24-hour monitoring window. Next rebalance opportunity: 2026-02-19 or later. Current holdings maintain quality+momentum exposure across energy leadership, defensive gold, financial stability, and selective technology with proper diversification across 5 sectors."
