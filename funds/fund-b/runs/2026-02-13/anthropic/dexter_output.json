    "why_now": "Cadence discipline overrides market timing. Portfolio constructed yesterday with high-conviction Quality + Momentum framework: Energy leadership (XOM/CVX 27%), diversified quality (LLY healthcare, JPM financials, XLI industrials), tech selectivity (AVGO/KLAC semiconductor leaders), and defensive hedge (GLD 18%). All holdings stable today with no material news deterioration. CVX Libya contract win reinforces energy thesis. Next rebalance 2026-02-19 allows thesis to mature and reduces unnecessary turnover. Weekly discipline prevents overtrading while maintaining responsiveness to material thesis changes."
