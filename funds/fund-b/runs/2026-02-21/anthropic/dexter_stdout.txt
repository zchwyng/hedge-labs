    "why_now": "Day 9 of systematic weekly hold period following February 12 full portfolio rebalance. Friday session showing return of risk appetite (SPY +0.72%, QQQ +0.89%) but portfolio construction remains appropriate with gold hedge continuing exceptional performance (+1.97% to $468.62, +9.1% cumulative), quality names resilient (JPM +0.71%), industrials steady (XLI +0.50%), semiconductors recovering (KLAC +1.78%). Energy showing pressure (XOM -2.22%, CVX -0.45%) but no thesis damage requiring emergency action. All falsifiable thresholds maintained with healthy cushions. Rebalance cadence enforces minimum 7-day spacing; next rebalance window opens February 26. Premature action would sacrifice process discipline and transaction cost efficiency for reactive management during normal sector rotation."

Kill-switch: AVGO <$305 or GLD <$440 triggers emergency review before scheduled rebalance."
