Factor highlights (from 1d tape only): hedge bid (GLD +0.63%) vs growth/semis softness (NVDA -2.49%, AVGO -1.42%) and financial weakness (V -3.01%). Risk budget: barbell (IT 30%, defensives/real asset 39% across HC/Energy/Materials) within max sector 80%. Scenario quick-check (qualitative, tool-limited): Equity index shock likely hurts NVDA/AVGO/META/AMZN; commodity shock hurts XOM/helps GLD; rates shock likely pressures duration-growth and helps GLD; USD shock ambiguous (UNKNOWN). Execution plan: none (non-rebalance day); monitor V relative performance + GLD momentum into next eligible rebalance; kill-switch triggers: at next rebalance if multiple holdings show negative 30d & 90d weekly momentum vs SPY/QQQ, consider up to 3 changes; if hedge sleeve (GLD) turns negative on both weekly windows, resize down."
