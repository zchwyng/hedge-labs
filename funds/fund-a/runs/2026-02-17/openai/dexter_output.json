    "thesis": [
      "Process edge: rebalance not due today (weekly cadence; min spacing 7 days) so turnover is disallowed; preserve signal integrity for the next scoring window.",
      "Tape confirmation is insufficient today: tool data only provides latest snapshots with 0.00% 1d changes for holdings and SPY/QQQ, so momentum/relative-strength gates cannot be re-evaluated.",
      "Risk management: avoid reacting to unverified drivers (earnings/guidance/news = UNKNOWN this run) and keep the barbell exposure (growth/quality + real-asset hedge) intact until eligible."
    ],
    "risks": [
      "Macro: if a risk-off shock emerges before next rebalance, concentrated growth exposure (NVDA/META/AVGO/AMZN) could draw down without an allowed intra-week rebalance.",
      "Idiosyncratic: single-name negative events (earnings/guidance/regulatory) are not screened today (news not fetched), so downside catalysts could be missed in real time.",
      "Execution/liquidity: snapshot volumes appear anomalously low in this feed (e.g., NVDA 5,904; META 814), so liquidity inference is unreliable today (treat as UNKNOWN)."
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "Next eligible rebalance: require tool-verified WEEKLY 30d/90d returns for each holding and SPY/QQQ; if any key holding lacks history, do not add risk and consider simplifying exposures.",
      "Next eligible rebalance: if V shows negative 30d AND 90d weekly returns and lags both SPY and QQQ on weekly closes, prioritize replacement within the 3-change cap."
    ],
    "why_now": "Base: rules discipline dominates—no rebalance allowed today, and tool evidence is limited to flat (0.00%) 1d snapshot changes. Bull: if the prior barbell thesis persists, holding avoids unnecessary slippage. Bear: if prior-flagged laggards continue to weaken, waiting could increase drawdown; mitigation is a scheduled, data-complete review at the next eligible weekly window where expected edge can be measured against trading-cost drag using weekly momentum + ratios/news."
