Execution plan: no trades; preserve turnover budget for next eligible rebalance with validated weekly histories. Monitoring/kill-switch: at next eligible rebalance, (1) require complete tool data for all holdings + SPY/QQQ, (2) if any holding shows negative 30d & 90d weekly momentum and material underperformance vs SPY/QQQ, de-rank/replace within cap, (3) if hedge sleeve (GLD) turns negative on both 30d & 90d weekly closes, resize down and reallocate to higher-scoring candidates."
