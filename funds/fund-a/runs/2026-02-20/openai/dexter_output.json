      "Catalyst: Process gate—weekly rebalance with minimum spacing (7 days) prevents turnover today; preserve signal integrity until next eligible weekly momentum/fundamental/news refresh.",
      "Factor edge: Avoid churn during a mixed tape (SPY -0.26%, QQQ -0.48%, GLD +0.28%) where single-day moves are noisy; maintain diversified barbell (Growth + Energy + Gold + Health Care).",
      "Variant view: If today’s index softness persists while gold remains bid, the portfolio’s GLD/XOM ballast is valuable; premature rotation out of core winners risks whipsaw without verified 30/90d weekly momentum."

    "risks": [
      "Macro: A sharper risk-off drawdown could hit concentrated mega-cap growth (NVDA/META/AVGO/AMZN) before the next eligible rebalance window.",
      "Idiosyncratic: Company-specific catalysts (earnings/guidance/regulatory) are not validated today (no tool-fetched news; UNKNOWN), so adverse surprises could emerge intra-week.",
      "Execution/liquidity: Deferring action can compress the decision window at next rebalance; mitigate then via staged sizing and limiting turnover to highest-conviction changes."
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "Next eligible rebalance (>=2026-02-26 given min spacing 7 days from 2026-02-19): require tool-verified WEEKLY history from 2026-01-21 (30d) and 2025-11-22 (90d) for all holdings plus SPY/QQQ; if any holding lacks history, do not add risk and prefer simplifying swaps only.",
      "If V underperforms SPY by >=2.0% cumulatively from 2026-02-20 close to next eligible rebalance close (tool-verified), elevate V to top replacement review; otherwise keep as neutral weight and reassess with fundamentals/news."
    ],
    "why_now": "Base: Not a rebalance day—expected edge does not clear turnover/trading-cost drag, so the optimal action is to hold. Bull: Growth holdings stayed positive even as SPY/QQQ were down, suggesting resilience; keep winners. Bear: Mixed-to-risk-off day (gold up, indices down) argues for keeping diversifiers (GLD/XOM) rather than rotating based on a single session."

Risk budget: max single 18% (<=40%), sector max IT 30% (<=80%), crypto 0% (<=10%). Scenarios (qualitative, tool-supported by holdings mix): equity index shock—growth sleeve largest hit; rates shock—LLY duration + growth sensitive; commodity shock—XOM/GLD offset in opposite directions; USD shock—GLD may hedge. Execution plan: none today (cadence gate); next eligible rebalance use staged reweights and cap changes to highest-conviction. Monitoring/kill-switch: if V relative weakness persists (>=2% vs SPY into next eligible rebalance) or if SPY/QQQ accelerate downside while GLD continues to outperform, prioritize defensive upgrades at the next allowed rebalance."
