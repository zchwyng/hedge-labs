      "Mandate constraint: rebalance is not due today, so the model portfolio must remain unchanged (weekly cadence with 7-day minimum spacing).",
      "Cross-asset signal is mixed: gold strength (GLD +2.49%) offset weakness in multiple growth holdings (NVDA -2.17%, AVGO -1.81%, META -1.47%), suggesting elevated dispersion rather than a clean trend.",
      "Avoids turnover on a single-day move; momentum/quality re-score (30/90d weekly + ratios/news) is deferred to the next eligible rebalance window."
    ],
    "risks": [
      "If today’s weakness in key holdings (e.g., NVDA, AVGO, META, V) extends into multi-week downside, waiting could increase drawdown before the next rebalance.",
      "If GLD’s sharp up day (+2.49%) reverses, the hedge sleeve could give back recent gains quickly.",
      "Without tool-verified news on a non-rebalance day, any interpretation of drivers is incomplete (earnings/guidance/catalyst status UNKNOWN)."
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "At next rebalance: if V’s 30d and 90d weekly returns are negative and lag SPY/QQQ on weekly closes, downgrade/consider replacement within the 3-change cap.",
      "At next rebalance: if GLD’s 30d and 90d weekly momentum turns negative (weekly closes), reduce hedge exposure and reallocate to higher-scoring quality+momentum equities/sector ETFs within constraints."
    ],
    "why_now": "Over the next 6–18 months, maintaining a barbell of quality growth (NVDA/META/AVGO) + defensives/real-asset ballast (LLY/GLD) can help across regime shifts; today’s tape shows dispersion (gold bid, growth soft) but with rebalance not due we prioritize rules-based discipline and will reassess with full weekly momentum + quality ratios + limited news at the next eligible rebalance."
