      "Rebalance not due today per mandate; portfolio must remain unchanged.",
      "Benchmarks were essentially flat (SPY +0.07%, QQQ +0.09%) while GLD provided positive ballast (+2.49%) amid softness in several growth names (e.g., NVDA -2.17%, AVGO -1.81%, META -1.47%).",

    ],
    "risks": [
      "If today’s downside in key holdings (e.g., V -3.09%, NVDA -2.17%) extends into a multi-week trend, waiting may increase drawdown before the next rebalance window.",
      "If GLD’s rally (+2.49% today) reverses sharply, the portfolio’s defensive sleeve could give back recent gains.",
      "Single-day moves can be noise; without verified catalyst/news today, signal quality is limited (news not fetched due to non-rebalance policy)."

    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If V continues to underperform both SPY and QQQ over the next several weekly closes (needs weekly return data at next rebalance), downgrade its momentum score and consider replacement.",

    ],
    "why_now": "Over the next 6–18 months, maintaining a mixed sleeve of growth + quality + diversifiers can help navigate regime shifts; today’s tape shows ongoing dispersion (gold up while several growth names down), but with rebalance not due we prioritize rule-consistent execution and will re-score momentum/quality at the next eligible weekly rebalance."
