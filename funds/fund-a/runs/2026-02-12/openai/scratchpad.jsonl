You must not give personal financial advice.\nYou are producing a research memo + a PAPER \"trade of the day\" candidate for comparison across models.\n\nRun metadata:\n- Run date: 2026-02-12\n- Fund name: Quality + Momentum (Monthly-hold)\n- Provider: openai\n- Model: gpt-5.2\n- Rebalance cadence: weekly\n\nRules:\n- Use only verifiable data you fetched via tools. If you cannot verify, write \"UNKNOWN\".\n- Time horizon: 30 days.\n- Universe: US large & mid cap only.\n- Portfolio constraints:\n  - Target positions: 12\n  - Min position: 2%\n  - Max position: 12%\n  - Max sector: 25%\n- Output must be deterministic: if multiple candidates are similar, pick the one with the strongest evidence and explain why.\n- `target_portfolio` must contain exactly 12 US equity tickers (no placeholders like `UNKNOWN`/`CASH`, and no ETFs/crypto).\n- Every holding weight must be >= 2 and <= 12; total portfolio weight must sum to 100%.\n- Sector exposure must satisfy max sector <= 25%.\n- `constraints_check.max_position_ok` and `constraints_check.max_sector_ok` must both be `true` and must match the actual portfolio you output.\n- You MUST call both `financial_search` and `financial_metrics` at least once before finalizing output.\n- If no prior portfolio is available, bootstrap a full diversified 12-name portfolio from verifiable US large/mid cap equities across at least 5 sectors.\n- Never output a partial portfolio.
