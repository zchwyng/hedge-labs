If you cannot verify, write \"UNKNOWN\".\n- Time horizon: 30 days.\n- Universe: US large & mid cap only.\n- Portfolio constraints:\n  - Target positions: 12\n  - Min position: 2%\n  - Max position: 12%\n  - Max sector: 25%\n- Output must be deterministic: if multiple candidates are similar, pick the one with the strongest evidence and explain why.\n- `target_portfolio` must contain exactly 12 US equity tickers (no placeholders like `UNKNOWN`/`CASH`, and no ETFs/crypto).\n- Every holding weight must be >= 2 and <= 12; total portfolio weight must sum to 100%.\n- Sector exposure must satisfy max sector <= 25%.\n- `constraints_check.max_position_ok` and `constraints_check.max_sector_ok` must both be `true` and must match the actual portfolio you output.\n- You MUST call both `financial_search` and `financial_metrics` at least once before finalizing output.\n- If no prior portfolio is available, bootstrap a full diversified 12-name portfolio from verifiable US large/mid cap equities across at least 5 sectors.\n- Never output a partial portfolio. Continue tool research until a valid full portfolio can be produced.\n\nTasks:\n1) Portfolio Health Check (if a prior portfolio exists in repo for this fund):\n   - Summarize what changed in the last 24-72 hours: earnings, guidance, macro surprises, major news.\n   - List any holdings with \"thesis damage\" signals.\n\n2) PAPER TRADE OF THE DAY (candidate, NOT an instruction):\n   - Propose exactly ONE action among: [\"Add\", \"Trim\", \"Replace\", \"Do nothing\"].\n   - If \"Add\": set `add_ticker` to the added ticker.\n   - If \"Trim\": set `remove_ticker` to the trimmed ticker AND `add_ticker` to where weight is reallocated.\n   - If \"Replace\": specify which holding is removed and which is added.\n   - Provide: thesis (3 bullets), key risks (3 bullets), falsifiable checks (2), and why-now (6-18 months).\n   - Provide position sizing suggestion within constraints (e.g. +2% to target).\n\n3) Update the model portfolio (paper):\n   - Output the full target portfolio weights after today's action, respecting constraints.\n   - Include a constraints check.\n\nOutput ONLY JSON:\n{\n  \"run_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\n  \"fund_name\": \"\",\n  \"paper_only\": true,\n  \"market_summary\": [\"\", \"\", \"\"],\n  \"thesis_damage_flags\": [{\"ticker\":\"\",\"why\":\"\"}],\n  \"trade_of_the_day\": {\n    \"action\": \"Add|Trim|Replace|Do nothing\",\n    \"remove_ticker\": null,\n    \"add_ticker\": null,\n    \"size_change_pct\": 0,\n    \"thesis\": [\"\",\"\",\"\"],\n    \"risks\": [\"\",\"\",\"\"],\n    \"falsifiable_checks\": [\"\",\"\"],\n    \"why_now\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"target_portfolio\": [{\"ticker\":\"\",\"weight_pct\":0,\"sector\":\"\"}],\n  \"constraints_check\": {\"max_position_ok\": true, \"max_sector_ok\": true, \"notes\":\"\"}\n}","timestamp":"2026-02-12T19:17:56.579Z"}
