    "US equities were mixed over the past 72 hours, with the S&P 500 consolidating near all-time highs amid ongoing Q4 earnings season.",
    "CPI data released yesterday showed core inflation slightly above expectations (MoM +0.3% vs. +0.2% est.), causing a brief spike in yields and rotation out of rate-sensitive sectors.",

    "thesis": [
      "Lam Research (LRCX) reported strong Q4 results, beating both revenue and EPS estimates, and raised FY guidance on robust semiconductor equipment demand.",
      "Momentum remains positive, with the stock outperforming the S&P 500 over 1, 3, and 6 months, supported by AI-driven capex cycles at major foundries.",
      "Balance sheet quality is high, with net cash position and consistent capital returns via buybacks and dividends."
    ],
    "risks": [
      "Semiconductor equipment orders are cyclical and could slow if macro conditions deteriorate or if foundry capex is delayed.",
      "Geopolitical tensions (e.g., US-China export controls) could impact LRCX's addressable market.",
      "Valuation is above historical averages, increasing downside risk if growth expectations are not met."
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If LRCX's next quarterly report shows order growth below 5% YoY, thesis should be re-examined.",
      "If major foundry customers (TSMC, Samsung, Intel) announce capex cuts of >10% in the next 6 months, thesis is at risk."

    "why_now": "LRCX is benefiting from a multi-year AI and memory upgrade cycle, with strong near-term momentum and quality metrics. Recent earnings and guidance upgrades provide visibility for the next 6-18 months, while sector rotation into semis continues post-CPI."
