      "If NVDA materially outperforms broad mega-cap tech over the next 30 days while fundamentals/valuation remain supported, the trim decision is likely wrong for this horizon.",

    "why_now": "Over the next 6–18 months, keeping factor exposure balanced between momentum leadership and durable cash generation can reduce concentration-driven volatility. NVDA remains high-quality but screens as expensive with relatively low FCF yield, and IT exposure is already at the sector cap. Reallocating 2% to FDX increases portfolio cash-flow yield exposure and adds Industrials diversification while keeping all positions within 2–12% and all sectors <=25%."
