      "Quality tilt upgrade: MSFT shows strong profitability (operating_margin 48.84%, net_margin 39.04%) and solid returns (ROIC 27.78%, ROE 30.51%) with moderate leverage (debt_to_equity 0.147).",

    "why_now": "The last ~1 month in the retrieved data shows a pronounced risk-off unwind in crypto and parts of tech. Reallocating 4% from BTC-USD into MSFT shifts exposure toward higher verified cash-flow quality and profitability while keeping AI/tech exposure; this is positioned for a 6–18 month regime where durable cash generation and balance-sheet strength can matter more if volatility persists."
