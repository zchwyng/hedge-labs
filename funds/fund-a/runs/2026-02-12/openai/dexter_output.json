      "Merck (MRK) delivered strong Q4 2025 results, beating consensus on both revenue and EPS, driven by robust growth in oncology (Keytruda) and vaccines.",
      "MRK exhibits high quality metrics: stable margins, strong free cash flow, and a healthy balance sheet with low leverage.",
      "Momentum is positive: the stock is outperforming the S&P 500 over 3- and 6-month periods, supported by upward earnings revisions and positive sentiment post-earnings."

    "risks": [
      "Keytruda faces potential biosimilar competition in the medium term, which could pressure margins.",

      "Healthcare policy changes or drug pricing reforms could negatively affect profitability."

    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If Keytruda sales growth decelerates below 5% y/y for two consecutive quarters, thesis is challenged.",
      "If MRK's operating margin falls below 25% for two quarters, quality thesis is at risk."

    "why_now": "MRK is showing both quality and momentum characteristics, with recent earnings and guidance upgrades. The stock is breaking out to new highs, and sector rotation into healthcare is evident as investors seek defensive growth amid macro uncertainty. Over the next 6-18 months, MRK is well positioned to benefit from its strong pipeline, resilient cash flows, and potential for capital returns."
