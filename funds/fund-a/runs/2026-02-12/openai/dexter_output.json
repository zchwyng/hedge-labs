    "thesis": [
      "Concentration control: Information Technology exposure is at the 25% sector cap; trimming V by 2% creates buffer while maintaining core quality exposure (company facts sectors fetched).",
      "Quality preserved: V still screens as high-quality on margins/ROIC with positive FCF yield (net margin ~50.2%, operating margin ~61.2%, ROIC ~47.7%, FCF yield ~3.86%; metrics snapshot as of 2026-02-12).",
      "Reallocate to defensive momentum: COST has positive 1-day momentum (+2.40%) and defensiveness characteristics; increase COST +2% to keep the portfolio within constraints and reduce single-sector tightness."

    "risks": [
      "If the market snaps back to growth/tech leadership, trimming V could lag near-term performance (30-day horizon risk).",
      "COST valuation risk: high P/E (~53.48) and PEG (~20.76) in snapshot metrics could limit upside despite momentum/defensiveness.",
      "News feed limitations: verified earnings/guidance catalysts for the last 72 hours are not captured here (UNKNOWN), so timing signal relies more on price action and constraints."
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If IT sector weight after the trim is still >25%, the action fails the sector constraint check (must be <=25%).",
      "If COST loses relative strength (e.g., reverses and underperforms while risk-off persists), the defensive reallocation thesis is weakened over the next 30 days."
    ],
    "why_now": "Over the next 6–18 months, a quality+momentum sleeve benefits from (a) maintaining exposure to durable compounders while (b) avoiding single-sector crowding. Today’s trim is driven by a binding portfolio constraint (IT at cap) and a near-term risk-off tape; reallocating marginal weight to a resilient consumer staple retailer (COST) keeps quality characteristics while improving constraint robustness."
