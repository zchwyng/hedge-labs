    "thesis": [
      "Shift 2% weight from idiosyncratic headline/regulatory risk (META) into steadier quality-momentum/defensive compounder exposure (COST).",
      "COST shows strong near-term momentum relative to tape (today +2.99%) and solid profitability/quality metrics (ROE ~0.274; FY operating margin ~4.0% with high asset turnover; valuation rich but consistent with quality).",
      "Portfolio-level risk reduction: lowers Communication Services concentration and increases Consumer Staples ballast within sector cap constraints."
    ],
    "risks": [
      "COST valuation is elevated (P/E ~53.8; EV/EBITDA ~31.2) so any multiple compression can hurt 30-day returns.",
      "META headline risk may fade quickly; trimming could underperform if risk-on resumes and META rebounds.",
      "Consumer staples factor rotation can reverse abruptly if rates fall/risk appetite returns."
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If additional credible reporting confirms material revenue/usage impact from Russia WhatsApp restrictions beyond current expectations, maintain/extend META trim; if policy reverses or impact is immaterial, thesis weakens.",
      "If COST price momentum reverses (e.g., breaks recent uptrend over coming weeks) while fundamentals/news remain unchanged, reduce the added overweight back to prior weight."
    ],
    "why_now": "Over the next 6–18 months, quality + momentum tends to benefit from durable cash generation and resilient demand. Today’s dispersion (defensives up, mega-cap growth down) plus META-specific headline risk favors a small rotation toward staples/quality without abandoning core tech/AI exposure."
