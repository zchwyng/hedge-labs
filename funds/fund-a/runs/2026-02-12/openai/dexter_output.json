    "why_now": "Over a 6–18 month lens, the portfolio maintains exposure to durable cash-flow compounding in mega-cap technology (software and semis) while retaining real-economy cyclicality (energy and machinery) and structurally strong health care demand. This mix aims to participate in continued AI/compute capex and productivity themes without breaching concentration limits, and it keeps optionality if leadership rotates across sectors."
