    "why_now": "Next 6–18 months likely remain defined by AI capex cycle + cloud/platform monetization, balanced by policy/regulatory uncertainty and rotation risk. With limited verified catalyst data beyond price snapshots, ratios, and mixed news headlines, the most deterministic decision is to hold exposures and avoid low-evidence churn into unverified alternatives."
