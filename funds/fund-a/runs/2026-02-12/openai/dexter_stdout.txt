    "thesis": [
      "Constraint-driven risk control: reducing crypto from 10% to 8% keeps exposure comfortably below the 10% cap while maintaining participation.",
      "Reallocate into a liquid diversifier: GLD provides non-equity exposure; after a -3.23% 1D drop, the add is sized modestly rather than a full dip-buy.",
      "Cross-asset weakness today (equities down, BTC down) argues for slightly higher ballast in the 30-day window."
    ],
    "risks": [
      "If crypto rebounds sharply, trimming BTC-USD can lag risk-on performance.",
      "If gold continues to sell off, GLD add can increase short-term drawdown rather than reduce it.",
      "Correlations can rise in stress regimes; GLD may not diversify when most needed."
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If over the next 2–3 weeks BTC-USD meaningfully outperforms GLD while equity volatility subsides, the reallocation was mistimed.",
      "If GLD keeps making lower lows while equities stabilize (SMH/TSM/CRWD stop falling), the ballast thesis is not working for this regime."
    ],
    "why_now": "Over the next 6–18 months, AI/semis/software remain core structural themes (TSM, SMH, CRWD, PLTR exposure), but episodic risk-off waves can be sharp. Keeping a modest, rules-compliant crypto sleeve while nudging weight toward a liquid diversifier (GLD) is intended to improve staying power through volatility without abandoning the growth/momentum posture.",
