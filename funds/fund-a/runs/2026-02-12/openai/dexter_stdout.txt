      "Execution risk: EPS expectations exist for upcoming quarters (e.g., FY 2026-03-31 EPS est 4.04), but near-term catalyst timing/earnings date from tools is UNKNOWN due to partial data availability (analyst estimates present; earnings date not fetched)."

    "why_now": "6–18 months: prefer compounding franchises with verifiable high margins and returns; in a volatile tape where mega-cap tech is selling off, reallocating from the sharpest single-day loser (AAPL) into a still-high-quality compounder (MSFT) aims to keep quality exposure while reducing short-term momentum damage (all based on tool-fetched price snapshots and MSFT ratios)."
