      "Portfolio action is constrained by missing verifiable prior holdings/weights (prior portfolio = UNKNOWN), making any Add/Trim/Replace non-deterministic and not tool-verifiable.",
      "Market regime over last ~3 sessions is risk-off (SPY/QQQ down; VXX up), so avoiding forced turnover is consistent with a quality+momentum process pending clearer signals.",

    "risks": [
      "Opportunity cost if a high-quality momentum winner emerges and we fail to add during drawdown.",

    "why_now": "6–18 months context is UNKNOWN for portfolio actions because the fund’s current holdings and factor tilts cannot be verified from the fetched data; near-term tape is risk-off with rising volatility proxy, favoring patience until verified company-specific earnings/guidance catalysts are available."
