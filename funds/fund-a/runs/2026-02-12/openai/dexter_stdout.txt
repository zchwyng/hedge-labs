    "Risk-off tape: broad sell-off pressure visible in multiple mega-cap growth names today (e.g., AAPL -4.03%, AMZN -2.26%, META -2.52%, AVGO -2.73%, NVDA -1.94%, MSFT -0.86%).",

    "thesis": [
      "META has the clearest, verifiable near-term headline/regulatory risk among current holdings (Russia/WhatsApp blocking threat) which can create 30-day volatility and narrative overhang.",
      "Price action is risk-off today for META (-2.52%); trimming reduces drawdown sensitivity while retaining exposure to the broader Comm Services platform theme via remaining weight.",
      "Portfolio construction: trimming META helps keep sector concentration disciplined while maintaining diversification across at least 6 sectors."
    ],
    "risks": [
      "Headline risk may not translate into material financial impact; trimming could reduce participation if shares rebound.",
      "Market may rotate back into high-beta growth quickly, making defensives lag and trimmed positions outperform.",
      "Other holdings also carry unmodeled risks (earnings/guidance not verified here); focusing on META may be incomplete."
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If additional verified news indicates the Russia/WhatsApp restriction is reversed/immaterial (or not progressing), the rationale for the trim weakens.",
      "If META shows sustained relative strength vs. peers over the next several sessions (vs. GOOGL and MSFT) despite the headline, volatility-overhang thesis is weakened."
    ],
    "why_now": "Over a 6–18 month horizon, platform businesses can compound if fundamentals stay strong, but near-term regulatory/geopolitical actions can introduce outsized tail risks. With a clear, verified adverse headline within 72 hours and a risk-off market tone today, trimming now is a deterministic risk-management step for a weekly-rebalanced, quality+momentum paper portfolio while keeping meaningful exposure."
