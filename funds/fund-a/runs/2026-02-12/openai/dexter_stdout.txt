    "Mega-cap growth (MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, AMZN, META, AVGO) broadly down on the day (about -0.4% to -3.7% in the snapshots), consistent with risk-off tape; single-name movers up: WMT +3.83%, COST +3.01%, LLY +2.80%, UNH +2.57%, RTX +2.44%.",
    "Defensives/quality cash-flow profiles showing relative strength today: retail staples (WMT, COST) and healthcare (LLY, UNH) green while cyclicals/energy (XOM -2.11%, CVX -1.21%) and financials (JPM -2.92%) softer.",
    "News successfully fetched (tool-limited) is mostly commentary/analyst-style for NVDA and CAT; other tickers' last-72h headline verification is UNKNOWN due to tool rate limits."

      "why": "Quality signal deterioration in the snapshot: earnings_growth -17.4% and EPS growth -17.3% (most recent period in ratios snapshot). While price is up today (+2.57%), this is a potential thesis-damage flag for a 'quality + momentum' sleeve if the negative earnings trend persists."

    {
      "ticker": "AMZN",
      "why": "Free cash flow growth is negative in snapshot (free_cash_flow_growth -24.3%) and FCF yield is low (0.53%), indicating weaker cash conversion vs. peers; not necessarily broken, but a monitor item for quality."
    },
    {
      "ticker": "JPM",
      "why": "Snapshot shows negative free_cash_flow_yield (-14.34%) and high leverage typical of banks (debt_to_equity 2.95); not thesis-breaking alone, but reduces 'quality' purity versus non-financials."

    "thesis": [
      "Momentum/relative strength: WMT is +3.83% on the day in the price snapshot, while several high-beta leaders are red; this fits a 30-day momentum tilt in a choppy tape.",
      "Quality/defensiveness: WMT shows positive earnings_growth (+7.34%) and EPS growth (+7.44%) in the ratios snapshot, with steady profitability metrics (net_margin ~3.26%, operating_margin ~4.68%) typical for the model's 'quality + momentum' ballast.",
      "Portfolio construction: replacing UNH (healthcare) with WMT (consumer staples) improves diversification and reduces exposure to a name with negative earnings trend signals (UNH earnings_growth -17.4% in snapshot) while keeping overall portfolio sector caps compliant."
    ],
    "risks": [
      "Valuation risk: WMT snapshot P/E is elevated (price_to_earnings_ratio ~46.7), leaving less room for multiple expansion if sentiment rotates back to cyclicals/high growth.",
      "Margin compression risk: low-margin retail model (operating_margin ~4.68%) can be sensitive to wage, shrink, and price competition; small margin changes can move earnings.",
      "Event/news verification risk: last-72h company-specific headline validation for WMT is UNKNOWN due to tool rate limits; an adverse verified catalyst could invalidate the near-term momentum view."
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If WMT’s next reported earnings_growth and EPS growth turn negative versus the current positive snapshot (revenue_growth ~1.43%, earnings_growth ~7.34%), the quality+momentum thesis weakens.",
      "If UNH earnings_growth and EPS growth revert to positive and sustain while price stabilizes, the 'replace' rationale is weaker; current snapshot shows -17% range for both."
    ],
    "why_now": "Over the next 6–18 months, the model prefers durable cash-flow businesses that can hold up through macro uncertainty while still exhibiting price leadership. Today’s tape shows defensive winners (WMT, COST) outperforming riskier mega-cap growth on the day, while UNH shows negative earnings/EPS growth in the latest snapshot. The swap upgrades near-term momentum and removes a quantified quality deterioration signal, consistent with weekly rebalance discipline for a 30-day horizon."
