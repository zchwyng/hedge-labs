      "Quality tilt: WMT shows positive earnings growth (+7.34% snapshot) and operating income growth (+7.68% snapshot) with very large scale (market cap ~1.03T) versus BA’s weaker profitability profile (very low margins; negative FCF yield in snapshot).",

      "Valuation risk: WMT trades at a high P/E (~46.22 in snapshot), making it sensitive to any slowdown in comps/margins.",
      "Execution/competition: E-commerce and delivery investments can compress margins; competitive intensity could reduce operating leverage (not directly verified in fetched news).",

    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If WMT underperforms on price momentum (e.g., turns negative on a rolling 3-session close-to-close basis while peers strengthen), the momentum leg is weakening.",
      "If WMT profitability deteriorates versus current snapshot signals (operating margin ~4.68%, net margin ~3.26%), the quality leg is weakening."
    ],
    "why_now": "Over the last few sessions, the tape is showing a defensive bid (KO/WMT positive) while several mega-cap growth and cyclicals are down on a short window. For a weekly-rebalanced, monthly-hold quality+momentum paper sleeve, rotating a small weight from a weaker-momentum, higher-balance-sheet-risk name (BA: negative FCF yield; low interest coverage in snapshot) into a large, liquid, currently positive-momentum staples name (WMT +2.95% over 3 sessions) is a higher-evidence adjustment. Over 6–18 months, WMT’s scale and steady earnings trajectory (snapshot growth figures) better fits the fund’s quality mandate than BA’s more binary recovery profile."
