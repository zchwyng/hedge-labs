      "Momentum signal confirmation is incomplete: 1M % returns and broad 72h ticker news could not be verified due to data rate limits (429), raising the risk of overreacting to a single risk-off session.",
      "Today’s move looks like cross-asset de-risking (SPY/QQQ/IWM/GLD/BTC/ETH all down same day), so single-name action risk > expected benefit for a 30-day horizon without cleaner catalyst data."
