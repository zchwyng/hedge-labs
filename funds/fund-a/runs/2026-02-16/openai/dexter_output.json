      "Mandate constraint: rebalance is not due today (weekly cadence, 7-day minimum), so the model portfolio must remain unchanged.",
      "Tape shows dispersion rather than a clean risk-on trend: GLD +2.49% vs. multiple growth/semis down (NVDA -2.17%, AVGO -1.81%, META -1.47%).",
      "Avoids turnover on single-day moves; full 30/90d weekly momentum + quality ratio re-score is deferred to the next eligible rebalance window."
    ],
    "risks": [
      "If weakness in key holdings (notably V, NVDA, AVGO, META) persists into multi-week downside, waiting could increase drawdown before the next rebalance.",
      "If GLD’s sharp up day reverses, the hedge sleeve could give back recent gains quickly.",
      "No tool-verified earnings/guidance/news was requested today (non-rebalance day), so driver attribution remains UNKNOWN."
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "At next eligible rebalance: if V’s 30d and 90d weekly returns are negative and lag SPY/QQQ on weekly closes, downgrade/consider replacement within the 3-change cap.",
      "At next eligible rebalance: if GLD’s 30d and 90d weekly momentum turns negative (weekly closes), reduce hedge exposure and reallocate to higher-scoring quality+momentum candidates within constraints."
    ],
    "why_now": "Over the next 6–18 months, a barbell of quality growth (NVDA/META/AVGO) plus defensives/real-asset ballast (LLY/GLD) can help across regime shifts; today’s close shows dispersion (gold bid, growth soft) but with rebalance not due we prioritize rules-based discipline and reassess with full weekly momentum/quality data at the next window."
