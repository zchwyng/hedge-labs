      "why": "1-month momentum is negative (~-14.9% from 2026-01-13 to 2026-02-13 close), which can impair near-term (30-day) trend capture despite high quality."

    "risks": [
      "Gold momentum can mean-revert quickly; GLD already had a large 1-month run-up (+7.9%) and could retrace.",
      "If risk-on resumes abruptly, crypto could rebound faster than gold, creating opportunity cost versus BTC-USD.",
      "Model concentration: increasing GLD weight reduces exposure to high-beta upside that can dominate 30-day returns."

    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If GLD 1-month trend breaks (e.g., closes materially below its recent range; last close in data is 454.75 on 2026-02-13), reduce/exit at next weekly rebalance.",
      "If BTC-USD stabilizes and regains positive 1-month momentum versus GLD by next rebalance check, reconsider re-adding within the <=10% crypto cap."
    ],
    "why_now": "Over the past month, BTC-USD experienced a deep drawdown (~-29.8%) while GLD rallied (~+7.9%), consistent with a regime favoring defensive/real-asset exposure. For the next 6–18 months, persistent macro/volatility risk (as reflected in recent cross-asset divergence) supports holding a liquid hedge alongside quality compounders; the immediate 30-day horizon prioritizes staying aligned with the strongest verified trend in this candidate set.",
