      "Diversifier sleeve for a tech/quality-heavy basket; today GLD is up +0.51% (454.33) while BTC is down -1.60% (66,954), supporting cross-asset diversification rationale.",
      "Recent price behavior shows GLD had a strong run into late Jan (price series peaked near ~494.56 on 2026-01-28) and remains elevated (454.33), consistent with positive intermediate momentum despite pullback.",

      "Momentum reversal risk: GLD pulled back materially after late-Jan highs (e.g., ~494.56 on 2026-01-28 to ~444.95 on 2026-01-30 in the series).",
      "Macro sensitivity: gold can fall if real yields rise or USD strengthens (macro drivers not verified in fetched data).",

    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If GLD closes below the early-Feb swing low (~427.13 on 2026-02-02 in the fetched daily series) on a weekly basis, diversification sleeve is failing (reduce/remove next rebalance).",

    "why_now": "Over the next 6–18 months, a dual-regime outcome (continued AI capex growth but intermittent risk-off shocks) is plausible; holding a 10% gold sleeve can improve risk-adjusted results for a quality+momo strategy without violating the no-broad-index-ETF rule."
