With headline-level signs of volatility/sell-off risk in the AI complex and a weekly rebalance cadence, adding a measured GLD sleeve now is a pragmatic way to keep upside participation while improving resilience for the next 6–18 months where AI capex cycles and policy/rate uncertainty can create regime shifts."
