      "Relative strength vs risk assets: GLD 30D close rose from 425.94 (2026-01-14) to 454.63 (2026-02-13) while mega-cap growth and crypto declined over the same window.",

      "Gold momentum can reverse quickly if real yields rise or risk appetite snaps back; GLD could underperform if growth rebounds.",
      "No verifiable last-72h GLD-specific news retrieved (news endpoint returned 404), so catalyst attribution is limited to price action only.",

      "If GLD loses its 30D uptrend (e.g., closes below 2026-02-03 close of 454.29 and fails to recover within a week), treat as momentum break for next rebalance.",
      "If tech complex reclaims leadership (e.g., MSFT/AMZN/GOOGL reverse and sustain higher highs vs their 30D range), reassess GLD weight as hedging need fades."

    "why_now": "Across the last month window (2026-01-14 to 2026-02-13), GLD is one of the few verified uptrending assets in the candidate set while major growth and crypto are trending down; adding GLD now diversifies factor exposure during an ongoing drawdown regime, while keeping the fund positioned to rotate back if risk assets regain momentum over the next 6–18 months."
