      "Positive 30D tape vs risk assets: GLD up from 425.94 (2026-01-14 close) to 454.63 (2026-02-13 close); BTC-USD down sharply over the same window (96955.16 to 67063.82).",
      "Diversification ballast for a tech-heavy quality/momentum sleeve while keeping sector concentration within limits (IT remains large but <80%).",

    "risks": [
      "Gold can mean-revert quickly if real rates/USD move against it; recent momentum may fail.",
      "GLD can be volatile (notably large swings around late January), so position sizing matters for a 30-day sleeve.",
      "Opportunity cost if high-beta risk assets rebound sharply; gold may lag in a risk-on snapback."
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "If GLD closes back below ~427 (near early-Feb close 2026-02-02 at 427.13) after entry, treat as momentum failure for this sleeve.",
      "If BTC-USD reclaims prior breakdown levels (e.g., sustained closes back above ~78k, near 2026-02-02 close 78666.85) while GLD stalls, the replacement rationale weakens."
    ],
    "why_now": "Over the next 6–18 months, AI/mega-cap narratives can drive equity volatility while cross-asset correlations can spike. Recent 30D behavior shows defensive hedges (GLD) holding up as some growth bellwethers (MSFT) and crypto (BTC-USD) weakened. A modest increase in gold exposure aims to improve drawdown resilience without relying on broad index ETFs and while staying within sector/crypto concentration constraints.",
