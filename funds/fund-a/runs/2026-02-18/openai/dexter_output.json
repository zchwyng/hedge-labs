    "Leadership snapshot: Semis/mega-cap growth bid (NVDA +2.51%, AVGO +1.11%, AMZN +1.23%, META +0.80%) while real-asset hedge mean-reverted hard (GLD -3.12%); Energy lagged (XOM -1.64%).",

      "Catalyst: Process discipline—rebalance cadence gate blocks turnover today (weekly; min spacing 7 days).",

    "risks": [
      "Macro: A sudden risk-off shock before next eligible rebalance could hit concentrated growth exposure (NVDA/META/AVGO/AMZN) while GLD’s hedge behavior is currently unstable on the day.",
      "Idiosyncratic: Earnings/guidance/regulatory developments are UNKNOWN today (no news pulled under non-rebalance policy), so adverse single-name catalysts may be missed intra-week.",
      "Execution/liquidity: If volatility persists (e.g., GLD -3.12% day move), delayed action could widen slippage at the next rebalance; mitigate with staged sizing then."

    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "Next eligible rebalance (>=2026-02-24): require tool-verified WEEKLY 30d and 90d returns for all holdings plus SPY/QQQ; if any holding lacks history, do not add risk and prefer simplification.",
      "If GLD posts another >2.5% single-day drop while SPY is green (per tool snapshots) before next rebalance, flag hedge instability and pre-plan a sizing review at the next eligible window (no action until then)."

    "why_now": "Base: rule-set dominates—no rebalance allowed, and only end-of-day snapshot data is verified. Bull: growth leadership reasserts (NVDA +2.51%, AVGO +1.11%, AMZN +1.23%, META +0.80%) while staying invested avoids churn. Bear: GLD’s sharp -3.12% drop and XOM -1.64% could signal factor rotation; the edge does not clear trading-cost/turnover drag without the required weekly momentum + fundamentals/news confirmation."

Execution plan: no trades; next rebalance use staged reweights if changes needed. Monitoring/kill-switch: if any single holding shows >10% adverse move from 2026-02-18 close before next eligible rebalance, escalate review; at next rebalance, remove bottom-ranked name(s) only if weekly 30d & 90d momentum both negative vs SPY/QQQ with corroborating news/quality deterioration."
