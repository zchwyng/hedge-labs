      "Catalyst: Process gate—weekly rebalance spacing blocks changes today; preserve signal integrity until next eligible rebalance window with refreshed WEEKLY 30/90d momentum + ratios/news.",
      "Factor edge: Avoid churn on a mixed leadership day (growth up, gold up, energy down). Let cross-asset signals (GLD bid vs XOM hit) develop before reallocating.",
      "Variant view: Today’s GLD strength (+1.97%) alongside SPY/QQQ strength suggests hedges are still being paid for; maintaining the GLD ballast may be valuable if risk sentiment deteriorates intra-week."
    ],
    "risks": [
      "Macro: A sharp risk-off move before next rebalance could hit growth concentration (NVDA/META/AVGO/AMZN) despite today’s strength vs benchmarks.",
      "Idiosyncratic: Earnings/guidance/regulatory developments for holdings are UNKNOWN today (no news pull allowed/used on non-rebalance day), so adverse surprises could emerge without warning.",
      "Execution/liquidity: Waiting concentrates decisions into the next rebalance date; mitigate then by staged sizing and limiting turnover to highest score deltas."
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "Next eligible rebalance (>= 7 days after 2026-02-20): require tool-verified WEEKLY history for all holdings from lookback_30d_start=2026-01-22 and lookback_90d_start=2025-11-23 plus SPY/QQQ; if any holding lacks history, do not add risk and prefer simplification only.",
      "If XOM continues to lag SPY by >=3.0% cumulatively from 2026-02-21 close to next eligible rebalance close (tool-verified), escalate XOM to top replacement review; otherwise treat as normal volatility."
    ],
    "why_now": "Base: Not a rebalance day—expected edge does not clear turnover/trading-cost drag, so the optimal paper action is hold. Bull: Growth leaders participated (AMZN/META/NVDA up) with QQQ outperforming SPY, supporting staying with winners. Bear: GLD also surged, hinting hedging demand; keep diversification rather than reacting to one-day XOM weakness absent verified catalysts."

Scenario quick-check (qualitative from 1d snapshot only): equity index shock—growth likely high beta; rates shock—UNKNOWN; commodity shock—GLD/XOM sensitivity mixed today (GLD up, XOM down); USD shock—UNKNOWN.
