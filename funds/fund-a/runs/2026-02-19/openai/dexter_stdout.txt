    "Regime (evidence-limited; non-rebalance day): mildly risk-on tape on the close with SPY +0.50% and QQQ +0.68%, while portfolio cyclicals/hedges also worked (XOM +3.28%, GLD +2.25%).",
    "Breadth/leadership snapshot: semis/mega-cap growth up (NVDA +1.54%, AMZN +1.76%, META +0.58%, AVGO +0.27%), energy led (XOM +3.28%); notable laggard today was LLY (-1.60%).",

      "Catalyst: Process gate—rebalance cadence (weekly; min spacing 7 days) blocks turnover today; maintain exposure while awaiting next eligible signal refresh (weekly 30/90d momentum + equity news/fundamentals).",
      "Factor edge: Avoid churn on single-day moves; today’s tape supported core growth (NVDA/AMZN/META/AVGO green) and diversifiers (XOM/GLD green) with only LLY red—insufficient evidence to justify turnover.",
      "Variant view: The simultaneous strength in GLD and QQQ can be consistent with mixed positioning (hedge bid + tech resilience); until weekly momentum confirms, do not over-interpret the cross-asset message."

    "risks": [
      "Macro: If a rapid risk-off shock hits before next eligible rebalance, concentrated mega-cap growth (NVDA/META/AMZN/AVGO) may draw down despite today’s positive close.",
      "Idiosyncratic: Equity news/earnings/guidance are not tool-verified today (UNKNOWN), so single-name adverse catalysts could emerge intra-week (esp. LLY given today’s relative weakness).",
      "Execution/liquidity: Delaying action can compress the window to adjust at the next eligible rebalance; mitigate then via staged sizing and limit turnover to highest-conviction moves."

    "falsifiable_checks": [

      "If LLY posts another <= -2.0% day while both SPY and QQQ are >= +0.5% on the same close (tool snapshots) before next rebalance window, flag as potential thesis drift and prioritize for replacement review at next rebalance (no action until eligible)."
    ],
    "why_now": "Base: Not a rebalance day—policy dominates; with only end-of-day snapshots verified, expected edge does not clear trading-cost/turnover drag. Bull: Broad green close across growth + energy supports staying invested. Bear: LLY weakness and mixed hedge signals (GLD up alongside QQQ) could foreshadow rotation; we wait for weekly 30/90d confirmation and equity news validation before acting."
