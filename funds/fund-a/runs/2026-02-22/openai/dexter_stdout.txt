    "Breadth/leadership snapshot: mega-cap growth participated (AMZN +2.59%, META +1.68%, NVDA +0.76%) while real-asset hedge also bid (GLD +1.97%); Energy lagged materially (XOM -2.22%), semis mixed (AVGO -0.41%).",

      "Catalyst: Process gate—rebalance not permitted today (weekly spacing). Preserve signal integrity; defer any rotation until we can re-score with tool-verified WEEKLY 30/90d momentum + (equities) ratios/news.",
      "Factor edge: Latest close shows risk-on participation (QQQ +0.89%) with core growth holdings up (AMZN +2.59%, META +1.68%, NVDA +0.76%); holding winners avoids churn when edge cannot be revalidated.",
      "Variant view: GLD +1.97% rising alongside QQQ suggests hedging demand persists even in an up-tape; keeping GLD ballast remains defensible until a full regime read is available."

    "risks": [
      "Macro: A fast risk-off impulse before next eligible rebalance could hit growth concentration (NVDA/META/AVGO/AMZN) despite today’s positive tape.",
      "Idiosyncratic: Earnings/guidance/regulatory headlines for holdings are UNKNOWN today (no equity news pull under non-rebalance policy).",
      "Execution/liquidity: Deferring decisions concentrates turnover into the next rebalance window; mitigate then via staged sizing and limiting changes to highest score deltas."
    ],
    "falsifiable_checks": [
      "Next eligible rebalance (>=7 days after last eligible date per system cadence): require tool-verified WEEKLY history for all holdings from lookback_30d_start=2026-01-23 and lookback_90d_start=2025-11-24 plus SPY/QQQ; if any holding lacks weekly history, do not add risk and prefer simplification only.",
      "If XOM underperforms SPY by >=3.0% cumulatively from 2026-02-21 close to the next eligible rebalance close (tool-verified), escalate XOM to top replacement review; otherwise treat as normal volatility."
    ],
    "why_now": "Base: Not a rebalance day—expected edge cannot be validated with required weekly momentum/ratios/news, so it does not clear trading-cost/turnover drag. Bull: Risk-on close with QQQ leading and key growth holdings positive argues for staying the course. Bear: Energy weakness (XOM -2.22%) and concurrent GLD strength (+1.97%) hint at latent defensiveness; holding diversification is preferable to reactive turnover without confirmatory data."

Risk budget: max position 18% (<=40%); sector concentration IT=30% (NVDA+AVGO) (<=80%); crypto=0% (<=10%). Scenario stress (qualitative, data-limited): equity index shock—portfolio likely down given growth tilt; rates shock—growth sensitive; commodity shock—GLD/XOM diversify; USD shock—mixed; quantitative P&L impact UNKNOWN without histories. Execution plan: no trades today; next rebalance stage changes over 1–3 sessions, cap turnover unless score delta is large. Monitoring/kill-switch: review XOM relative performance vs SPY threshold (-3% from 2026-02-21 close to next eligible rebalance); any large gap moves (>5% 1d) in NVDA/META/LLY trigger immediate news/filing check at next permitted tool window."
